    <p><strong>Week 12:</strong> API's and Fetch</p>
    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of the student's Week 12 API's and Fetch assignment:<br><br>üìä Completion (<span class="score">150/160 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ Fetch API used properly for data retrieval<br>‚úÖ Async/await implemented effectively <br>‚úÖ Create (POST) functionality working well to add new entities<br>‚úÖ Read (GET) functionality displaying data correctly<br>‚úÖ Delete functionality implemented and removes entities<br>‚úÖ Forms properly connected to API for creating posts<br>‚úÖ json-server used as the API backend<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Update (PUT) was implemented but marked as optional (-10 points)<br><br>Rafael did an excellent job implementing the core CRUD functionality using fetch and async/await. The app can create, read and delete entities through the API as required. Update was also added which shows great initiative, but it was an optional requirement. Overall, a very strong completion of the key assignment objectives! üíØ<br><br>üìù GitHub (<span class="score">130/140 points</span>)  <br>‚úÖ Repository is accessible and all code is available<br>‚úÖ File structure is logical and well-organized<br>‚úÖ Code is clean and contains helpful comments<br>‚úÖ README file provides good overview of the project<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Commit history is a bit light, a few more commits showing incremental progress would be better (-10 points)<br><br>The GitHub repository is set up properly with all the required code. The file structure makes sense and the code quality is very good with clear comments. The README gives a nice explanation of the project. The only area for improvement is the commit history - seeing a few more commits that show the development process would make it even stronger.<br><br>üìà Errors (<span class="score">70/70 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ No console errors observed during usage<br>‚úÖ All CRUD operations via the API work without errors<br>‚úÖ Proper error handling for issues like failed API calls<br>‚úÖ Async/await used correctly without any errors<br>‚úÖ UI responds properly to interactions without breaking<br><br>I didn't encounter any errors during my testing of Rafael's app. The CRUD operations all worked smoothly, async/await was used properly, and the interface was responsive. Error handling also seems to be in place to deal with any API issues gracefully. Fantastic work delivering an error-free experience! üî•<br><br>üì± Video Explanation (<span class="score">25/30 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ Clearly explains the core project functionality <br>‚úÖ Demonstrates the key CRUD operations effectively<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Could discuss the API integration challenges faced in a bit more depth (-5 points)<br>‚úÖ Shows some of the important code but a full walkthrough would be even better<br><br>Rafael's video does a good job concisely explaining what the app does and demonstrating the CRUD features in action. He touches on the key technologies used but discussing the challenges faced in more depth would make the explanation even stronger. A quick code walkthrough is provided but diving deeper into the core components would be great. Overall though, the video gives a nice overview of the great work done!<br><br>üåü Total Score: <span class="score">375/400 points</span><br><br>Rafael delivered a very impressive implementation of the Week 12 APIs and Fetch project! The app fully leverages fetch and async/await to enable CRUD operations via the API. The UI is functional and the code is well-structured and error-free. <br><br>Some areas for improvement:<br>- A few more Git commits to detail the development process<br>- Deeper discussion in the video of API integration challenges and code structure<br><br>But overall this is excellent work that demonstrates a strong grasp of using APIs in a web app. Well done Rafael! üëè<br><br>Keep up the great work and let me know if you have any other questions!
