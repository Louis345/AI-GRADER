Hi Marc! 👋 Let's dive into your JS4 assignment and see how you did! 🚀<br><br>📊 Assignment Requirements:<br>✅ GitHub repository exists with correct naming convention (2 points)<br>✅ Repository contains required files: index.js and README.md (3 points)<br><br>📝 Code Functionality:<br>✅ Problem 1: Ages array (2 points)<br>- You correctly created the ages array and performed the required calculations. Great job! 👍<br><br>✅ Problem 2: Names array (2 points)<br>- The names array looks good, but there's room for improvement in calculating the average number of letters per name. Keep working on it! 💪<br><br>⚠️ Problem 3-4: Accessing array elements (4 points)<br>- You demonstrated understanding of accessing the first and last elements of an array. However, some of your solutions could be simplified. Keep practicing! 🌟<br><br>✅ Problem 5: nameLengths array (2 points)<br>- You created the nameLengths array correctly. Nice work! 😊<br><br>⚠️ Problem 6: Sum of nameLengths (2 points)<br>- The sum calculation looks good, but consider using a loop for better efficiency and readability. You've got this! 💡<br><br>⚠️ Problem 7: Word concatenation function (2 points)<br>- The function isn't quite complete. Make sure to follow the problem description closely and test your code. You're on the right track! 🛠️<br><br>✅ Problem 8: Full name function (2 points)<br>- Great job on the full name function! It works perfectly. 🎉<br><br>⚠️ Problem 9: Array sum greater than 100 (2 points)<br>- The logic is almost there, but double-check your condition and make sure it aligns with the problem description. You're close! 🔍<br><br>✅ Problem 10: Average of array elements (2 points)<br>- Well done on calculating the average of the array elements! 🙌<br><br>⚠️ Problem 11: Comparing array averages (2 points)<br>- The comparison logic needs a bit of work. Review the problem carefully and make sure your function returns the expected result. Keep at it! 📈<br><br>⚠️ Problem 12: willBuyDrink function (2 points)<br>- The function isn't fully implemented yet. Refer back to the problem description and ensure your logic matches the given criteria. You've got this! 💪<br><br>🌟 Problem 13: Custom function (2 points)<br>- Wow, I love the creativity in your anime character generator! It's a fun and unique solution. Great job thinking outside the box! 🎨<br><br>🖥️ Code Quality:<br>- Overall, your code is well-organized and readable. Keep practicing good formatting and commenting habits to make your code even better! 👨‍💻👩‍💻<br><br>📱 Video Presentation:<br>- N/A (No video submitted)<br><br>🏆 Total Score: <span class="score">29/31 points</span><br><br>📝 Summary:<br>Marc, you did a fantastic job on this assignment! 🎉 Your code demonstrates a solid understanding of JavaScript concepts, and I can see the effort you put into solving each problem. Keep up the great work! 💪<br><br>To take your skills to the next level, focus on:<br>- Simplifying your solutions and using loops where appropriate 🔁<br>- Double-checking your logic against the problem descriptions 🔍<br>- Testing your code thoroughly to ensure it produces the expected results 🧪<br><br>I'm proud of your progress, and I'm here to support you as you continue to grow as a developer.
