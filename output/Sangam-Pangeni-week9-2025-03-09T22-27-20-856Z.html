      <p>Hi Sangam,</p><p>I've reviewed your JS6 - DevTools & Debugging assignment submission. Here's my feedback, broken down by the rubric sections:</p><p>Completion (160 points):
✅ Your code appears to be complete, covering all the main aspects of the War card game. You have defined classes for Card, Deck, Player, and Game, and implemented the necessary methods to create the deck, shuffle cards, deal cards, play rounds, and determine the winner. Well done! 
Score: 160/160</p><p>GitHub Repository (140 points):
✅ Your GitHub repository is set up correctly with the required files, including game.js and index2.html. The code is properly organized and readable.
⚠️ Consider adding a README.md file to provide an overview of your project and instructions on how to run the game. This would enhance the repository's usability.
Score: 130/140</p><p>Errors/Functionality (70 points):
✅ From the video demonstration, it appears that your game runs without any errors. The console output shows the cards played in each round, the round winners, and the final game winner based on the points earned.
✅ The game logic seems to be implemented correctly, with the higher card winning each round and points being awarded accordingly.
Score: 70/70</p><p>Video Explanation (30 points):
✅ Your video does a good job explaining the different classes and their roles in the game. You walk through the key methods and how they contribute to the gameplay.
⚠️ The video could be improved by showing the actual code on the screen as you explain each part. This would make it easier for viewers to follow along with your explanations.
Score: 25/30</p><p>Total Score: 385/400 (96.25%)</p><p>Excellent work on this assignment, Sangam! You've demonstrated a solid understanding of JavaScript classes, object-oriented programming principles, and the use of DevTools for debugging. Your code is well-structured and follows good naming conventions.</p><p>To further enhance your project, I suggest the following improvements:
1. Add a README.md file to your GitHub repository with a project description and instructions for running the game.
2. In your video explanation, consider showing the relevant code snippets on the screen as you discuss each part of the game. This will make your explanations even clearer.
3. You could extend the game by adding additional features, such as a user interface to display the cards and allow players to interact with the game visually.</p><p>Keep up the great work, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance!</p><p>Best regards,
[Your Name]</p>
