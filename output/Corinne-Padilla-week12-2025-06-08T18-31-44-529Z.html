Hey there Corinne! 👋 I've finished reviewing your Week 12 Coding Project on APIs and Fetch. Let's dive into the feedback! 🌊<br><br>📊 Completion (160 points)<br>⚠️ From what I can see in your GitHub repository, it looks like the project is still in the early stages. I don't see the required HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that implement the CRUD functionality and API interaction. To earn full points here, make sure to include all the core elements outlined in the assignment description. You've got this! 💪<br>Points: 0/160<br><br>📝 GitHub Repository (140 points)  <br>✅ Awesome job setting up your GitHub repository! The package.json and package-lock.json files are present, which is a great start. 👍<br>⚠️ However, I noticed that the repository is missing the main project files (HTML, CSS, JS) and the README. Don't forget to add those in and provide a clear README explaining your project. Keep up the good work! 🌟<br>Points: 70/140<br><br>📈 Errors/Functionality (70 points)<br>⚠️ Since the main project files are not yet present in the repository, I wasn't able to assess the functionality and check for any errors. Once you've added your code, I'll be happy to take another look and provide feedback on this aspect. You've got the skills to nail this! 🔨<br>Points: 0/70 <br><br>📱 Video Explanation (30 points)<br>👏 I see that you submitted a video, which is fantastic! Videos are a great way to showcase your work and explain your thought process.<br>⚠️ Unfortunately, I wasn't able to evaluate the content of your video as no transcript was available. In the future, consider enabling closed captions or providing a written summary of your video explanation. This will ensure I can fully understand and appreciate your work! 📝<br>Points: 15/30<br><br>🎉 <div class="total-score">Total Score: <span class="score">85/400</span></div><br><br>📣 Summary:<br>Corinne, you're off to a solid start with your Week 12 Coding Project! 🚀 Setting up the GitHub repository is a crucial first step. To take your project to the next level, focus on implementing the core functionality and user interface. 💻 Add those HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to bring your CRUD application to life! Don't forget to leverage fetch and async/await to interact with the API seamlessly. 🌐<br><br>I'm excited to see your progress! If you have any questions or need guidance, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you every step of the way. 💪✨<br><br>Keep coding and keep shining! 🌟<br>Your instructor,<br>[Your Name]
