Hi Hector,<br><br>Thanks for your submission for the Week 12 API's and Fetch assignment. I can see you put in a lot of effort to understand and implement the concepts. Here's my evaluation:<br><h2>CODE ANALYSIS - API IMPLEMENTATION (Week 12):</h2><h3>API Integration Check:</h3>‚ö†Ô∏è It appears you built a full-stack application with a MongoDB database and Express backend, which is great! However, the focus of this assignment was integrating with an existing third-party API using fetch or axios on the client-side. I don't see evidence of external API calls in your code.<br><h3>CRUD Operations Check:</h3>‚úÖ CREATE operation with POST request <br>‚úÖ READ operation with GET request<br>‚úÖ UPDATE operation with PUT request<br>‚úÖ DELETE operation with DELETE request<br>‚úÖ Forms for adding data<br><br>While you implemented CRUD well, these operate against your own backend API and database rather than an external API, which was the core requirement.<br><h2>Completion: <span class="score">40/160 points</span></h2>You've built an impressive full-stack CRUD app, but without the required integration of an external third-party API, I can only award partial credit based on the rubric. The maximum score for submissions without real external API calls is 40 points.<br><h2>GitHub: <span class="score">100/140 points</span></h2>‚ö†Ô∏è I was unable to access your GitHub repo at the provided URL. Please double check the link and repo permissions. From the video, your project structure and code look well-organized. Ensure all files are pushed and the repo is public.<br><h2>Errors: <span class="score">50/70 points</span></h2>Your app looks fully functional based on the video, with all CRUD operations working against your backend. I didn't see error handling for network issues or invalid API responses, which is important when working with external APIs.<br><h2>Video: <span class="score">30/30 points</span></h2>Excellent video! Your demonstration covered all aspects of the app and code. Audio and video quality were great. Nice work explaining your process and challenges.<br><br>Total: <span class="score">220/400 points</span><br><br>I'm impressed with the initiative you took to learn Express and MongoDB to build a back-end for your app. Those skills will serve you well. However, this particular assignment was specifically assessing client-side integration with third-party APIs.<br><br>To fully meet the requirements, try refactoring to pull data from an external API (e.g. SWAPI) using fetch(). Implement error handling for those API calls.<br><br>You're clearly working hard to learn and apply these concepts. Keep up the effort! Let me know if you have any other questions.<br><br>Best regards,<br>The Grading Bot
