Hi Test Student! üëã<br><br>I've reviewed your submission for the Bootstrap Project assignment. Here's my detailed feedback, including a breakdown of your score in each rubric category:<br><br>üìä Completion & Requirements (30 points)<br>‚ö†Ô∏è I wasn't able to fully evaluate the completion of your project, as I encountered issues accessing the specific files in your GitHub repository. Based on the limited information available, it appears you have some key components like index.html and package.json, which is a good start! üí™ <br><br>However, to assess completion against the rubric, I need to be able to view your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. Please double check that your repo is public and all files are properly committed. Once I can access the full project, I'll be happy to update my evaluation! <br>Current score: 10/30 pts<br><br>üìù GitHub Repository (25 points) <br>‚úÖ You successfully created a GitHub repository for your project - great job! Having your code on GitHub is an important part of the assignment.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è As mentioned above, I ran into problems viewing the repository files themselves. Let's make sure everything is pushed and the repo is public. That will allow me to provide more meaningful feedback on your code! <br>Current score: 15/25 pts<br><br>üìà Functionality (15 points)<br>‚ö†Ô∏è I was unable to test your project's functionality directly, since I couldn't access all the necessary files in your repo. From the limited info available, it seems you're on the right track with having JS and HTML components. <br>üí° In the future, it can be helpful to include a README.md file outlining how to run your project and any key functionality. That gives a high-level overview for the instructor.<br>Current score: 5/15 pts<br><br>üì± Video Explanation (10 points)<br>‚ö†Ô∏è I also ran into an issue retrieving the transcript for your explanation video. Double check that you included the correct public YouTube URL, and ensure the video has closed captions enabled.<br>The video review is an important part of understanding your thought process and hearing you explain your code. So let's make sure we get that working!<br>Current score: 0/10 pts<br><br>üñ•Ô∏è Total Score: <span class="score">30/80 points</span><br><br>I know it can be frustrating when technology doesn't cooperate, but don't let that discourage you! üí™ I'm here to help. My main recommendation is to double check your GitHub repo and YouTube video settings. Make sure the repo is public and the video has captions. Those two changes should allow me to access everything I need for a complete review.<br><br>You're off to a solid start with setting up your project structure. Now let's get those finishing touches in place! Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions. You've got this! üöÄ<br><br>Looking forward to seeing your project in action,<br>Your Instructor
