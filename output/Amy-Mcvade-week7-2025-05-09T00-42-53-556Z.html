📝 Assignment Evaluation for Amy Mcvade (Hainsamy@gmail.com)<br><br>Hello Amy! 👋 I've reviewed your JS4 - ECMA Script assignment and here is my detailed feedback. Let's go through each section of the rubric:<br><br>📊 Repository (10 points)<br>✅ GitHub repository is set up correctly with the required files (10/10)<br>Great job setting up your GitHub repository with the necessary JavaScript, HTML and README files! The file structure looks organized. 💯<br><br>📱 JS Code Functionality (25 points)<br>✅ Code executes without errors (5/5)<br>✅ Code meets all requirements outlined (15/15)<br>⚠️ Some requirements need further work (3/5)<br>Your code executes without errors and meets most of the assignment requirements, which is fantastic! 🌟 However, there are a few areas that need improvement:<br>- The average letters per name calculation seems incomplete. Make sure you are summing the total letters correctly before dividing.<br>- For accessing the first and last elements of an array, double-check the index used. array[array.length - 1] gives the last element, while array[0] gives the first.<br>- The nameLengths array creation also looks incomplete. Ensure you are pushing the length of each name into the new array.<br>Keep up the good work, but do review those parts of your code for accuracy. You're on the right track! 💪<br><br>🖥️ HTML Structure (5 points)<br>✅ Basic HTML page with JS script linked (5/5) <br>Your HTML file is structured properly and links the JavaScript file. Well done! 🔥<br><br>📈 Video Explanation (20 points)<br>✅ Video covers all code explanations (10/10)<br>✅ Clear and concise, easy to follow along (10/10)<br>Excellent job on your video explanation! 🎥 You walked through each part of your code, provided insights into your thought process, and made it easy to understand. Your explanations were clear and concise. I appreciate you sharing the challenges you faced, like remembering exact syntax - that's completely normal and improves with practice. 👍 Keep up the great work!<br><br>🌟 <div class="total-score">Total Score: <span class="score">52/60</span></div> 🌟<br><br>Amy, you did a fantastic job on this assignment! 🎉 Your code demonstrates a solid understanding of arrays, loops, functions, and basic JavaScript concepts. You explained your work well in the video too.<br><br>A few suggestions for improvement:<br>- Review the requirements closely and make sure your code fully implements each one 🔍<br>- Double-check array indexing and make sure you're performing operations on the correct elements 🔢<br>- When you get stuck, don't hesitate to consult the course materials, documentations, or reach out for help 🙋‍♀️<br><br>Overall, you should be proud of what you accomplished here! 👏 Keep practicing and coding - you're making great progress. Feel free to ask any questions. I'm here to support you in your learning journey! 😊<br><br>Happy coding! 👩‍💻<br>[Instructor Name]
