    <div id="content-to-copy">
      <p>Here is my evaluation of your JavaScript Final Project:</p><p>Completion (160 points):
✅ Project includes required files (index.html, script.js) (20 pts)
✅ Game logic is implemented correctly (80 pts)
✅ Code is well-organized and readable (40 pts)
✅ Game runs without errors (20 pts)
I'm giving you full points for Completion. Your project meets all the requirements and runs as expected. Well done!
160/160</p><p>GitHub (140 points):
✅ Repository is named correctly (20 pts) 
✅ All project files are included (20 pts)
✅ Commit history shows consistent progress (40 pts)
✅ README file provides relevant information (30 pts)
⚠️ Code comments could be more thorough for explaining complex logic (30 pts)
Your GitHub repository looks great overall. I'd just recommend adding some more detailed code comments, especially for trickier parts like the shuffleDeck method. That will make your code even easier to understand.
110/140</p><p>Errors/Functionality (70 points):
✅ Game successfully creates and shuffles the deck (20 pts)
✅ Players' hands are dealt correctly (10 pts)
✅ Each turn properly compares cards and awards points (20 pts) 
✅ Final score and winner are determined accurately (20 pts)
No issues here, your game functions exactly as it should. Nicely implemented!
70/70</p><p>Video (30 points):
✅ Speaker is clearly audible (10 pts)
✅ Explanation demonstrates understanding of the code (10 pts)
⚠️ Some key parts could be explained in more detail, like the game loop logic (10 pts)
You explained your code well in the video. I'd suggest spending a bit more time walking through the core game logic so viewers can fully understand how it works. But overall, solid presentation.
20/30</p><p>Total Score: 360/400 (90%)</p><p>In summary Matthew, this is impressive work! Your War card game is fully functional and your code is clean and well-structured. The video shows you have a strong grasp on the core concepts. </p><p>Some suggestions for future improvement:
<ul><li>Use more detailed code comments, especially for complex logic</li>
<li>Provide thorough explanations in your video for the most important code sections</li>
<li>Consider adding some extra features or polish to go above and beyond</li></ul></p><p>But all in all, this is a great project submission. You should be proud of what you've built here. Let me know if you have any other questions!</p>
