Hi Hatim! 👋 Thanks for submitting your Bootstrap project. I've reviewed your work and have some feedback for you. Let's go through it section by section:<br><br>📊 Completion (30 points)<br>I was able to access your GitHub repository, but had some trouble viewing all the files. From what I could see, it looks like you have a good start with an index.html, JavaScript files, and testing components. However, I couldn't fully evaluate the completion of all the Bootstrap requirements like multiple pages, navbar, tables, forms etc. <br>⚠️ In the future, please make sure your repo is public and all files are properly pushed. For now, I'll award <span class="score">15/30 points</span> in this category. With a bit more work to meet all the requirements, I'm confident you can get full marks here! 💪<br><br>📝 GitHub Repository (25 points) <br>You successfully created a GitHub repository and committed some code, which is great! 🌟 It seems to have a logical structure for a web project.<br>💡 To get full points, make sure to have a complete README file explaining your project, and that all required final code files are pushed. I'll give <span class="score">20/25 points</span> for this section.<br><br>📈 Error-Free Functionality (15 points)<br>I wasn't able to fully test your site's functionality without access to all the files. But I didn't see any glaring errors in the code I could view. <br>I'll award <span class="score">10/15 points</span> here, and I'm happy to reevaluate when you submit your updated code! 🚀<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (0 points)<br>N/A - No video was required for your submission. This section does not apply to your grade.<br><br>🖥️ Total Score: <span class="score">45/70 points</span><br>Overall, this is a solid start Hatim! 👏 I can see you put effort into setting up your repo and project files. The main area for improvement is making sure to push all your final Bootstrap code and requirements. <br><br>Here are my suggestions:<br>- Carefully review the assignment requirements and use them as a checklist ✅ <br>- Make your repository public 🔓<br>- Confirm all your HTML/CSS/JS files are properly pushed to GitHub 📁<br>- Add a README thoroughly explaining your project 📝<br>- Resubmit or reach out if you have any questions! 📬<br><br>You're on the right track - keep up the coding and let me know if you need any help! I'm confident you'll do great with a few tweaks. 😄<br><br>Happy coding! 👨‍💻<br>Your instructor,<br>Farza
