      <p>Hi Matthew,</p><p>I've reviewed your Week 12 Coding Assignment on APIs and Fetch, and here is my evaluation of your work based on the provided rubric:</p><p>Completion (0/50): ⚠️
<ul><li>The required CRUD functionality (without update) using json-server or another API is not fully implemented.</li>
<li>Fetch and async/await are used in parts, but the API interaction is incomplete.</li>
<li>Forms for creating/posting entities and deletion functionality are present but not fully functional.</li>
<li>Fetched entities are not properly displayed.</li></p><p>GitHub Repository (30/35): ✅
<li>The GitHub repository is set up correctly with the necessary files.</li>
<li>The code is properly organized into separate files (index.html, index.js, styles.css).</li>
<li>The repository could benefit from a more descriptive README explaining the project's purpose and functionality.</li></p><p>Errors/Functionality (10/35): ⚠️
<li>The code contains errors that prevent the application from functioning as intended.</li>
<li>The server setup and API integration are incomplete, leading to issues with fetching and manipulating data.</li>
<li>Buttons for fetching, updating, deleting, and creating teams are present but not fully operational.</li></p><p>Video Explanation (20/30): ✅
<li>The video provides a clear overview of the project and its components.</li>
<li>You explain the purpose of each file and the intended functionality.</li>
<li>The video could be enhanced by demonstrating the working features of the application and explaining the challenges faced during development.</li></ul></p><p>Total Score: 60/150 (40%)</p><p>Matthew, I appreciate your effort in attempting this assignment despite the challenges you faced with setting up the server and integrating the API. It's clear that you have a good understanding of the project structure and the required components.</p><p>To improve your work, I suggest focusing on the following areas:
1. Ensure that the server and API are properly set up and configured to enable seamless data fetching and manipulation.
2. Implement the CRUD functionality completely, including the ability to create, read, update (if required), and delete entities using the API.
3. Display the fetched entities in a user-friendly manner, ensuring that the data is properly rendered on the webpage.
4. Test your code thoroughly to identify and fix any errors that prevent the application from functioning as intended.
5. Enhance the video explanation by demonstrating the working features and discussing the challenges you encountered and how you attempted to overcome them.</p><p>Keep practicing and exploring different resources to strengthen your understanding of APIs, server setup, and data manipulation. Don't hesitate to seek assistance from your instructor or peers when needed.</p><p>I believe that with more practice and perseverance, you'll be able to master these concepts and deliver a fully functional application. Keep up the good work, and feel free to reach out if you need further guidance or support!</p><p>Best regards,
Your Instructor</p>
