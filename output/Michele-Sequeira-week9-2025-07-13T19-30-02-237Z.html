    <p><strong>Week 9:</strong> JavaScript Unit Final Coding Project - WAR Card Game</p>
    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of the WAR Card Game JavaScript project based on the provided rubric and available information:<br><br>üìä Completion (<span class="score">140/160 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ It appears you implemented the core game logic using OOP concepts like Card, Deck, Player, and Game classes, which is great! The game seems to deal cards, play rounds automatically, track points, and declare a winner. <br>‚ö†Ô∏è I couldn't fully verify the tie handling and some other details since I don't have access to the full code. But based on your video explanation, it sounds like you covered the key requirements. Well done overall!<br><br>üìù GitHub (<span class="score">40/140 points</span>)  <br>‚ö†Ô∏è Unfortunately I was unable to access your GitHub repository to evaluate your code and project setup directly. There seemed to be an unknown error preventing access.<br>üí° In the future, double check your repo visibility settings and access links. It's important to ensure your code is accessible for evaluation.<br>‚ú® However, your video explanation did highlight some good coding practices like clear class structures and method names. So I've awarded some partial credit based on that.<br><br>üìà Errors (<span class="score">60/70 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ From what I could see in the video, your game seems to run without any major crashes or errors, which is awesome! The gameplay flow looked smooth.<br>üëè You showed the game playing through multiple rounds and tracking points, so it appears the core functionality is working properly.  <br>‚ö†Ô∏è I couldn't fully test edge cases or verify the final score accuracy without the code. But you've earned most of the points here based on the successful demo.<br><br>üì± Video Explanation (<span class="score">30/30 points</span>)<br>üåü Fantastic job on the video walkthrough! You showed the game running from start to finish and explained how your code works very clearly. <br>üíØ I really liked how you highlighted your OOP class structures and the key methods driving the gameplay. It's clear you have a strong grasp of the concepts.<br>üî• Your screen share and voiceover were very easy to follow. Excellent work demonstrating the different parts of your code!<br><br>üåü Total Score: <span class="score">270/400 points</span><br><br>Overall this is a very solid project implementation! You've demonstrated a good understanding of OOP principles and JavaScript coding to create a functional card game. The video explanation was top-notch and helped me understand your code structure and approach.<br><br>The main area I couldn't fully evaluate was the GitHub repository, since there was an access error. But you still earned a passing grade based on the many strengths shown in the video demo and explanation. With some minor tweaks to ensure your repo is accessible, I think this would be close to a perfect submission.<br><br>Keep up the great work! You're definitely on the right track with your JavaScript skills. Let me know if you have any other questions!
