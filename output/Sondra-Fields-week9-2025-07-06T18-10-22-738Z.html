    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of your WAR Card Game assignment:<br><br>📊 Completion (<span class="score">150/160 points</span>)<br>✅ Great job using classes for Card, Deck, and Player - this shows a solid understanding of OOP structure! 👏<br>✅ Your code successfully deals 26 cards to each player from a 52-card deck. Well done! 🌟<br>✅ The game iterates through all 26 rounds automatically as expected. 🔥 <br>✅ Points are correctly awarded to the player with the higher card each round. 💯<br>✅ Ties are handled properly with no points awarded. Nice! ✨<br>⚠️ While the game runs and outputs results to the console, consider adding some extra flair with emojis or formatting to make it even more engaging! 💡<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">125/140 points</span>)  <br>✅ Your repository is set up properly on GitHub and the code is accessible. 👍<br>⚠️ Good start on code comments, but aim to be even more thorough in explaining key functionality. 🛠️<br>⚠️ I didn't see a .gitignore file excluding node_modules. Make sure to add that in the future! 📝<br>✅ Your code structure is clean and well-organized overall. Nice work! ✨<br>✅ Variable and function names are clear and meaningful. 🌟<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">65/70 points</span>)<br>✅ Fantastic, the game runs without any crashes or errors! 🎉<br>✅ All 26 rounds are played correctly from start to finish. 🚀 <br>✅ Cards are dealt properly to both players. 💯<br>⚠️ Double check the final score - looks like there may be a small bug in how ties are factored in. 🔍<br>✅ No major logical errors detected in the overall game flow. Nicely done! 👏<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">0/30 points</span>)<br>⚠️ Looks like you didn't include a video walkthrough for this submission. Make sure to add that next time, as it's a great way to showcase your code and explain your thought process! 📹<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">340/370 points</span><br><br>Overall, this is a strong submission that demonstrates a good grasp of OOP principles and JavaScript fundamentals. Your code is well-structured and the game plays smoothly. There's room for improvement in the code commenting and README, and be sure to include that video next time. <br><br>Keep up the great work, Sondra! You're making awesome progress. 💪 Let me know if you have any other questions!
