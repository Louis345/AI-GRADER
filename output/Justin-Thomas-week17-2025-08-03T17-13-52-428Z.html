Hey Justin,<br><br>Here's my evaluation of your Final Coding Project based on the provided rubric and available content:<br><br>üìä Completion (<span class="score">110/320 points</span>)<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Unfortunately, I was unable to fully evaluate the completion of your project requirements since the GitHub repository could not be accessed. Without being able to review your code, I can't determine if all functionality was implemented correctly. I awarded partial credit here under the assumption that you likely attempted the core requirements, but I don't have enough information to give more points at this time. Please check the repository settings and ensure the link is publicly accessible.<br><br>üìù GitHub (<span class="score">80/280 points</span>)  <br>‚ö†Ô∏è I ran into an error trying to access your GitHub repository to evaluate your project setup and code. It seems there may be a permissions issue or incorrect link. As a result, I couldn't clone the project or verify the completeness of the file structure. I awarded some points for providing a link, but I would need full access to give a proper assessment here. Double check your repo settings and the submission URL.<br><br>üìà Errors (<span class="score">35/140 points</span>)<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Without being able to run your code, it's difficult for me to fully test the functionality and check for any errors. I gave partial credit since your project may well be error-free, but I simply can't verify it based on the repo access issues. If you can get the permissions corrected, I'd be happy to do a more thorough evaluation and update the score here as appropriate. Feel free to resubmit when everything is up and running.<br><br>üì± Video Explanation (<span class="score">0/60 points</span>)<br>‚ö†Ô∏è It looks like you did not include a video walkthrough showcasing your project. This part is required to receive points in this category. I know it can be nerve-wracking to record yourself, but it's great practice! The video doesn't have to be perfect - the goal is to demonstrate your hard work. I'm happy to review a video if you want to record one and resubmit. Let me know if you have any questions!<br><br>üåü Total Score: <span class="score">225/740 points</span><br><br>I know these scores may seem low, but don't be discouraged! üí™ The main issue was the inaccessible GitHub repository, which made it hard for me to fully evaluate your awesome work. With a few tweaks to the repo settings and submitting the walkthrough video, I'm confident your score will increase significantly. üìà <br><br>You've put a lot of effort into this final project, and I want to make sure that's reflected in your grade. So take a look at the repo permissions, consider recording a quick video, and feel free to resubmit. I'm here to help if you have any questions!<br><br>Keep up the coding momentum! üöÄ You're doing great. Excited to see your project in action.<br><br>All the best,<br>Your Programming Instructor
