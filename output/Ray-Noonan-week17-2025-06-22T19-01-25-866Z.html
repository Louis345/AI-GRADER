Hey Ray! 👋 I've finished grading your final React project. Here's the breakdown:<br><br>📊 Completion (<span class="score">220/320 points</span>)<br>You did a solid job implementing the core requirements of the React app! ✅ The task list and form are working. 👏 However, it looks like the update functionality (changing color) may be missing or incomplete. ⚠️ To get full points, make sure all the specified CRUD operations are fully implemented. Keep up the great work! 💪<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">80/280 points</span>)  <br>Thanks for providing the GitHub repository link! 🙏 However, I encountered a 403 error when trying to access the specific project files. 😕 Please double check that the repository is set to public and all the code files are properly committed and pushed. Feel free to reach out if you need any help troubleshooting! 🛠️<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">70/140 points</span>)<br>From what I could see in the video, the core functionality of adding and deleting tasks seems to be working without any major errors, which is awesome! 🎉 Just be sure to test thoroughly to catch any small bugs. ⚠️ And don't forget about error handling - it's always good practice to gracefully handle any potential issues. 💡 Keep up the solid coding! 👨‍💻<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">30/60 points</span>)<br>I appreciate you taking the time to record a video walkthrough! 🙌 It gives a helpful overview of what you built. To take it to the next level, I'd recommend showing a clear demo of all the project requirements in action. 📽️ And don't be afraid to let your passion and personality shine through in the presentation! 🌟 Looking forward to seeing your skills grow. 😄<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">400/800 points</span><br><br>Overall, you're off to a strong start with React, Ray! 🚀 The task list and add/delete functionality are a solid foundation. To reach for a higher score, focus on getting the GitHub repository working, fully implementing all the CRUD operations, and showcasing everything in the video. 📈 <br><br>I know you've got the determination to keep learning and improving. 💪 Feel free to reach out anytime if you have questions or want advice! You've got this! 👍<br><br>Let me know if there's anything else I can help with. Keep coding and stay awesome! 😎<br><br>Your friendly neighborhood code grader,<br>[Your Name] 🤖
