      <p>Hi Tiana,</p><p>I've reviewed your final coding project submission and evaluated it based on the provided rubric. Here's my assessment:</p><p>Completion (320 points):
✅ Your project appears to meet the core requirements of creating a React application with CRUD operations and connection to an API. You have a product listing page, individual product details, and a functioning shopping cart. Well done on covering the key aspects. (320/320)</p><p>GitHub (280 points): 
✅ Your GitHub repository is properly set up and contains all the necessary code files and assets. The code is organized into appropriate components and follows good structure. (280/280)</p><p>Errors/Functionality (140 points):
⚠️ While most of the functionality works as expected, there are a couple of areas that could be improved:
<ul><li>The "Add to Cart" button on the product listing page adds the selected quantity to all products instead of just the individual product. (-20 points)</li>
<li>Updating the quantity in the cart doesn't automatically refresh on the frontend, requiring a manual page refresh. (-20 points)</li>
Otherwise, the core functionality of listing products, viewing details, adding to cart, and removing from cart is working. (100/140)</p><p>Video (60 points):
✅ Your video walkthrough does a good job explaining your project. You demonstrated the main features and highlighted key aspects of the code. The audio and visual quality is clear. (60/60)</p><p>Total Score: 760/800 (95%)</p><p>You've done an excellent job overall with this project! The React application is well-structured, and the majority of the features are working as intended. There are just a couple of functionality issues to iron out.</p><p>Some suggestions for improvement:
<li>Look into fixing the "Add to Cart" functionality on the product listing page to only add the selected quantity for the specific product.</li>
<li>Debug the issue with the cart quantity update not automatically refreshing on the frontend. Consider using state management or a useEffect hook to re-fetch the cart data after an update.</li>
<li>Perhaps add some more styling to enhance the visual appeal of the application.</li></ul></p><p>Keep up the great work, Tiana! You've demonstrated a solid understanding of React, API integration, and CRUD operations. With a bit more polish, this project will be top-notch. Feel free to reach out if you need any clarification or have additional questions.</p><p>Best regards,
Your Instructor</p>
