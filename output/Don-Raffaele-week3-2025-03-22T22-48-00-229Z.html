      <p>Hi Don,</p><p>I've completed reviewing your Bootstrap coding project submission. Here's my feedback for each section:</p><p>Completion (25/30 points):
✅ You successfully created a multi-page Bootstrap website with required elements like a navbar, table, and form.
⚠️ The assignment asks for a footer, but I didn't see one implemented on all pages. Make sure to include a footer consistently.</p><p>GitHub (20/25 points): 
✅ You provided the GitHub repository link, allowing me to access and evaluate your code.
⚠️ For future projects, consider adding a README file to your repository to provide an overview and any setup instructions.</p><p>Errors/Functionality (10/15 points):
✅ The navbar works well for navigating between pages.
⚠️ The responsive image sizing could be improved. You mentioned difficulties getting the image to stretch fully across the screen.
⚠️ Some minor formatting inconsistencies, like indentation and spacing, are present in the code.</p><p>Video (7/10 points):
✅ Your video covered the main aspects of your project, explaining the key Bootstrap components used.
⚠️ The audio quality made it a bit challenging to follow at times. Consider using a microphone for clearer sound in future videos.
⚠️ More detail on your specific implementation choices and the benefits of using Bootstrap would enhance the explanation.</p><p>Total Score: 62/80 (78%)</p><p>In summary, you've done a solid job implementing a responsive Bootstrap website with the required components. Your understanding of the framework is evident in the functional navbar and the use of Bootstrap classes for layout and styling.</p><p>To take your project to the next level, focus on refining the responsive image sizing, ensuring consistent use of a footer across pages, and paying attention to code formatting. For the video, aim for crisp audio and dive a bit deeper into your thought process and the advantages of the Bootstrap features you utilized.</p><p>Keep up the great work, Don! I can see your web development skills growing. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance.</p><p>Best regards,
Your Instructor</p>
