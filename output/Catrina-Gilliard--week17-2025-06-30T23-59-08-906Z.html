Here is my evaluation of Catrina's final project assignment:<br><br>📊 Completion (<span class="score">0/320 points</span>)<br>⚠️ Unfortunately, no code files were found in the GitHub repository submitted for this project. Based on the grading rubric, since no code was submitted, 0 points are awarded in this section. To receive points here, the React application needs to be implemented with the required functionality - API connection, CRUD operations, etc. Let me know if you have any questions! 💪<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">0/280 points</span>)  <br>⚠️ The GitHub repository URL was provided, but the repository appears to be empty with no project files present. For full credit, the complete React project should be committed and pushed to GitHub. This allows me to clone the repository and run the application to test the functionality. Feel free to resubmit once you've added your project code! You've got this! 🚀<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">0/140 points</span>)<br>⚠️ Since no project code was submitted, I was unable to evaluate the functionality and check for any errors. To earn points in this category, make sure to commit your working React application to the GitHub repo. I'll be happy to take another look and provide feedback once you've uploaded your code. Keep up the hard work! 💯<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">0/60 points</span>)<br>⚠️ No video walkthrough was provided with this submission. Recording a short demo video showcasing your project's key features is a great way to highlight your work. Consider adding one in the future to really make your project stand out! You're doing great! 👏<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">0/740 points</span><br><br>💡 Moving forward, make sure to commit your full React project to GitHub before submitting. This will allow me to review your code, provide specific feedback, and evaluate the functionality against the rubric. If you have any questions or need clarification on the requirements, don't hesitate to reach out. You've made it to the final project, which is awesome. I know you can do this! Stay motivated and keep coding. 👩‍💻👨‍💻<br><br>✨ I'm looking forward to seeing your completed project. Feel free to resubmit when you've added your code to GitHub. You've got the skills to create something great. Believe in yourself and let your coding abilities shine! 🙌<br><br>Let me know if there's anything else I can assist with. You're almost at the finish line! 🎉
