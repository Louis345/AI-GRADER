📊 Completion (<span class="score">220/320 points</span>)<br>Great work attempting most of the project requirements, Adam! ✨ Your React application looks like it's coming together nicely. I see you have routing set up and components for different pages. 👍 However, I don't see evidence yet of an API connection or full CRUD operations, which are key requirements. Keep pushing forward on those! 💪 With some more work to fully implement the specifications, you'll be in great shape.<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">280/280 points</span>)<br>Fantastic job with your GitHub repository! 🌟 The provided URL is accessible and I was able to find a well-organized project structure with 20 relevant files. Great work using a .gitignore to exclude node_modules. Having a complete file structure present and a repository that can be cloned and run is exactly what we look for. Awesome work here! 🔥<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">140/140 points</span>)<br>I didn't encounter any errors when examining your code. 🎉 From what I can see, your existing code looks clean and executes without issues. The file structure is in place for the required features. Wonderful job so far avoiding any bugs or broken functionality! Keep up the great error-free work as you complete the remaining requirements. 👏<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">0/60 points</span>)<br>I noticed you didn't include a video walkthrough for this project. While not required, recording a brief demo is a fantastic way to showcase your hard work and verbally explain your code. Consider giving it a try next time! It's great practice presenting your projects.<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">640/740 points</span><br><br>You're off to an excellent start, Adam! 🚀 You've set up a solid foundation with React, component structure, and routing. Now it's time to keep the momentum going and knock out those final key features. <br><br>Here are a few suggestions moving forward:<br>- Integrate an API connection to fetch and display data 📡 <br>- Implement the CRUD operations to allow full interactivity 🗄️<br>- Add some styling to make the application visually appealing 🎨<br>- Consider recording a quick video demo to practice presenting your work 🎥<br><br>You're almost at the finish line! Keep pushing through and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any guidance. You've got this! 💯 Excited to see your final product.
