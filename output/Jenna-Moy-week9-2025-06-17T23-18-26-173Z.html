    <p><strong>Week 9:</strong> JavaScript Unit Final Coding Project - WAR Card Game</p>
    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of Jenna's WAR Card Game assignment:<br><br>📊 Completion (<span class="score">140/160 points</span>)<br>Jenna implemented a working version of the WAR card game using object-oriented programming principles in JavaScript. ✅ She created Card and Deck classes to model the game components. 🌟 The game deals cards to two players, compares their hands each round, and awards points appropriately. 💯 It runs through all 26 rounds automatically and declares a winner at the end based on the score. <br><br>However, some of the OOP structure and class design could be improved. The Player class is missing, and game logic is mixed into the other classes. Separating concerns more clearly and using a Player class would make the code cleaner and easier to extend. 🔨 <br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">105/140 points</span>)  <br>Jenna's GitHub repository is set up properly and the code is accessible there. 👍 The JavaScript code is organized into a single file and the repository contains the expected HTML and configuration files.<br><br>However, the code is lacking in comments to explain the functionality. ⚠️ While the variable and function names are clear, there should be header comments for each class and key method to describe what they do. 🛠️ The repository is also missing a .gitignore file to exclude the node_modules directory.<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">70/70 points</span>)<br>From the video demonstration and code review, Jenna's WAR game appears to run without any crashes or errors. 🎉 The 26 rounds execute properly, with cards dealt and points tracked accurately. There are no obvious logical errors in the game flow. Excellent work on error-free code! 🔥<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">20/30 points</span>)<br>Jenna's video shows the game running from start to finish and demonstrates the final result. 🎥 She briefly explains some of the key code components like the classes and methods.<br><br>To get full points here, the video should go into more depth explaining how the code works behind the scenes and the OOP concepts applied. 💡 More thorough code walkthroughs and clearer audio would improve this section. Keep working on your presentation skills! 💪<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">335/400 points</span><br><br>Overall this is a strong submission that demonstrates a good grasp of the core project requirements. With some refactoring to better organize the classes and add comments, plus a more detailed video explanation, this would be an outstanding project. Well done, Jenna! 🚀 Let me know if you have any other questions.
