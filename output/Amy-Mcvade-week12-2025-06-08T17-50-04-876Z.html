Hi Amy! 👋 I've reviewed your CRD (Create, Read, Delete) application assignment and I'm excited to share my feedback with you. Let's dive in! 🌟<br><br>📊 Completion (160 points)<br>✅ Your application allows users to create, read, and delete tasks using a JSON server. Great job implementing these core functionalities! You've earned the full 160 points for this section. 💯<br><br>📝 GitHub Repository Setup (140 points)<br>✅ Your GitHub repository is properly set up with all the required files, including the HTML, JavaScript, and JSON files. The file structure is clear and organized. Well done! 👏<br>⚠️ However, I noticed that your README.md file could use some more detail. Consider adding a brief description of your project, instructions on how to run it, and any dependencies required. This will make it easier for others to understand and run your application. You've earned 120 points for this section. 📈<br><br>🖥️ Errors/Functionality (70 points)<br>✅ Your application runs without any major errors, and the core functionalities of creating, reading, and deleting tasks work as expected. Nicely done! 🚀<br>💡 One suggestion for improvement: Consider adding some error handling for edge cases, such as when the server is unavailable or when invalid data is submitted. This will make your application more robust. You've earned 60 points for this section. 💪<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (30 points)<br>✅ Your video explanation covers the main aspects of your application, including the HTML structure, JavaScript code, and functionality. I appreciate your effort in walking through the code and explaining the different parts. 👍<br>⚠️ To further enhance your video, I recommend providing a live demonstration of your application in action. Show the process of creating, reading, and deleting tasks, and explain how the code enables these functionalities. This will give viewers a clearer understanding of how your application works. You've earned 25 points for this section. 🌟<br><br>🎉 <div class="total-score">Total Score: <span class="score">365/400</span></div> 🎉<br><br>Amy, you've done a fantastic job on this assignment! 🙌 Your application demonstrates a solid understanding of creating a CRD application using a JSON server and implementing the necessary functionalities. Keep up the great work! 💫<br><br>To take your application to the next level, consider the following suggestions:<br>1. 🔨 Enhance your README.md file with more detailed information about your project and how to run it.<br>2. 🛠️ Implement error handling to make your application more resilient.<br>3. 🎥 Include a live demonstration of your application in your video explanation to provide a clearer understanding of its functionality.<br><br>I'm confident that with these improvements, your application will be even more impressive.
