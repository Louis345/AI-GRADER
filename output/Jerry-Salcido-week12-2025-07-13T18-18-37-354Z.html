    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of the Week 12 Lab assignment by Jerry Salcido:<br><br>📊 Completion (<span class="score">110/160 points</span>)<br>✅ Fetch API used for data retrieval (20/20)<br>✅ Async/await implemented properly (20/20)<br>⚠️ Create (POST) functionality working (10/20) - There were issues with adding students due to incompatibility between the server format and the code. Partial points awarded for attempting the implementation.<br>✅ Read (GET) functionality displaying data (20/20)  <br>✅ Delete functionality implemented (20/20)<br>✅ Forms properly connected to API (20/20)<br>✅ json-server or alternative API used (20/20)<br><br>Jerry made a solid attempt at implementing the core CRUD functionality. The read and delete operations are working well. However, there were some compatibility issues with the create/post functionality that prevented it from working fully. Overall, this shows good progress, with some room for improvement in ironing out the API integration. 💪<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">140/140 points</span>)  <br>✅ Repository properly created and accessible (20/20)<br>✅ File structure is logical and organized (40/40)<br>✅ Code is clean and well-commented (40/40)<br>✅ README file explains project setup (20/20)<br>✅ Commit history shows development progress (20/20)<br><br>Fantastic work on the GitHub portion! The repo is well-organized with a clear file structure. Code is clean and includes helpful comments. The README provides good context on the project. And the commit history demonstrates the progression of your work. Nicely done! 🌟<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">50/70 points</span>)<br>✅ No console errors during operation (10/20) - There were some errors logged in the console when trying to add a student.<br>✅ All CRUD operations work correctly (10/20) - Create functionality had some issues.<br>⚠️ Error handling for failed API calls (10/20) - Did not see explicit error handling for failed API requests. This is an area to improve.<br>✅ Proper async/await usage without errors (20/20)<br>✅ UI responds correctly to user interactions (20/20)<br><br>The application runs relatively smoothly apart from the create student errors. Async/await is used properly which is great to see. The UI is responsive. To take this to the next level, consider adding some error handling for API failures and ironing out that student creation bug. Keep up the coding! 👨‍💻👩‍💻<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">25/30 points</span>)<br>✅ Clear explanation of project functionality (10/10)<br>⚠️ Demonstration of all CRUD operations (5/10) - Would have liked to see a successful student creation, but good demos of the other operations.<br>✅ Discussion of API integration challenges (10/10) <br>❌ Code walkthrough showing key components (0/0) - The video focused more on demoing the app than walking through the actual code implementation.<br><br>The video does a nice job explaining the project and demoing the working parts of the app. Your discussion of the challenges faced with the API integration was insightful. In future videos, aim to also walk through some of the key code snippets to give a behind-the-scenes look at how you built it. Overall though, this video gives a solid project overview! 🎥<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">325/400 points</span><br><br>Jerry, you clearly put a lot of effort into this lab and have the core parts working. Your code is well-organized and the app runs smoothly apart from the student creation. Really nice work on the async/await implementation and overall functionality!<br><br>To take this to the next level, focus on:<br>1) Resolving that POST error to get student creation working<br>2) Adding some error handling for any failed API requests<br>3) Doing a quick code walkthrough in your video to showcase your work<br><br>Keep up the strong effort and happy coding! You're making great progress. 🚀 Let me know if you have any other questions!
