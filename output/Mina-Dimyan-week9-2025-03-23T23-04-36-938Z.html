      <p>Alright, let's dive into your JS6 - DevTools & Debugging assignment! 🚀 I've closely reviewed your GitHub repository and the provided video, and I'm excited to share my feedback with you. Let's break it down section by section:</p><p>📊 Completion (160 points)
✅ Your code demonstrates a solid understanding of the assignment requirements. You've created a functional JavaScript application that utilizes debugging tools effectively. Great job! 👏
Points awarded: 160/160</p><p>📝 GitHub Repository (140 points) 
✅ Your GitHub repository is set up correctly with the necessary files. The code is well-organized and easy to navigate. 🌟
⚠️ However, I noticed that your repository lacks a detailed README file. It's important to include a README that provides an overview of your project, instructions on how to run it, and any additional information that would be helpful for others to understand your code. 💡
Points awarded: 120/140</p><p>📈 Errors/Functionality (70 points)
🔥 Your JavaScript code is free of syntax errors and runs without any major issues. The game logic is implemented correctly, and the unit creation, shuffling, and gameplay are all functional. Excellent work! 💯
Points awarded: 70/70</p><p>📱 Video Explanation (30 points)
⚠️ While you provided a video, it seems to be quite short and lacks a detailed explanation of your code and the debugging process. In the future, try to walk through your code step by step, explaining your thought process and how you used debugging tools to identify and resolve any issues. 🛠️
Points awarded: 20/30</p><p>🖥️ Total Score: 370/400</p><p>💪 Overall, you've done an impressive job on this assignment! Your code demonstrates a good grasp of JavaScript concepts and debugging techniques. Keep up the great work! 🚀</p><p>Here are a few suggestions for improvement:
1. Add a comprehensive README file to your GitHub repository to provide more context and guidance for others who view your code. 📝
2. When creating explanatory videos, aim to provide more in-depth insights into your code and debugging process. Walk through your code step by step and share your thought process to help others understand your approach better. 🎥
3. Consider adding more comments throughout your code to improve readability and make it easier for others (and your future self) to understand your logic. 💡</p><p>Keep practicing and refining your debugging skills, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance. I'm here to support you in your learning journey! 💪✨</p><p>Happy coding! 😊</p>
