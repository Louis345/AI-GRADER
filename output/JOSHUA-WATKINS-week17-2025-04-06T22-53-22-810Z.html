    <p>Hey there! 👋 I've reviewed your final project submission and have some feedback for you. Let's go through it section by section, following the grading rubric. 📝</p><p>📊 Completion (320 points)
✅ You submitted a project that meets the basic requirements, including a React application that connects to an API and performs CRUD operations. Great job on that front! I'm assigning you the full 320 points for completion. 🌟</p><p>📱 GitHub Repository (280 points)
✅ Your GitHub repository is set up correctly with all the necessary files and components. The code is organized and readable. Fantastic work there! 💯 You've earned the full 280 points for the GitHub portion.</p><p>🖥️ Errors/Functionality (140 points)
⚠️ While your application does perform the basic CRUD operations, there are a few areas that could use improvement:
<li>Error handling could be more robust to provide a better user experience 💡</li>
<li>Some of the functionality, like updating the cart, doesn't seem to persist on the server side 🛠️</li>
Based on this, I'm assigning you 100 out of 140 points for the functionality section.</p><p>📈 Video Explanation (60 points)
⚠️ In your video, you expressed a lot of frustration with the course curriculum and teaching style. While I understand your perspective, the video should focus more on explaining your project and demonstrating its features. The personal commentary detracted from the overall presentation. 📝
I'm assigning you 30 out of 60 points for the video portion.</p><p>🎉 Total Score: 730 / 800 points</p><p>💪 Overall, you did put together a working project that meets the core requirements. That's a solid accomplishment, especially given the challenges you faced with the curriculum! 👏</p><p>🚀 Moving forward, I'd recommend focusing on:
1. Diving deeper into the core concepts to solidify your understanding 📚
2. Practicing building projects independently to reinforce your skills 🧩
3. Seeking out additional resources and communities to support your learning journey 🌐</p><p>You've got this! Keep coding and growing. 💫 If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you! 😊</p><p>Let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this feedback. Wishing you all the best in your future endeavors! ✨</p>
