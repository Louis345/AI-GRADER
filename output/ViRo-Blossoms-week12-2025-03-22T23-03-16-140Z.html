      <p>Thank you for sharing your Week 12 coding project. Here is my evaluation based on the provided rubric and guidelines:</p><p>Completion (160 points):
✅ The project runs with json-server or another API
✅ The project uses fetch and async/await to interact with the API
✅ A form is used to create/post new entities 
✅ Users can delete entities
✅ Entities are fetched from the API and displayed
160/160 points</p><p>GitHub Repository (140 points): 
✅ All project code is uploaded to a GitHub repository
✅ Code is organized into separate files (index.html, index.js, db.json)
140/140 points</p><p>Errors/Functionality (70 points):
⚠️ The project compiles without errors and runs, but some functionality is slow or glitchy at times due to PC performance issues. Core functionality of creating, displaying, editing and deleting entities works.
60/70 points </p><p>Video Explanation (30 points):
✅ A screen recording walking through the project is provided
✅ The video demonstrates the project working with an explanation
✅ Challenges and resolutions are discussed
30/30 points</p><p>Total Score: 390/400 (97.5%)</p><p>You did an excellent job implementing the core functionality of a CRUD app that interacts with an API using fetch and async/await. The ability to create, display, edit and delete entities is all there. </p><p>The only area I took some points off was Errors/Functionality, since you mentioned performance issues and some lag/slowness, likely due to recording on an older PC. But the core functionality is implemented correctly.</p><p>I'm glad you were able to resolve the rendering bug with help from a friend. Debugging can be challenging, but systematically reviewing the code and getting a second pair of eyes is a great approach.</p><p>For future improvements, focus on optimizing performance if possible and adding more styling with CSS/Bootstrap. But overall, this is a strong implementation of the assignment requirements. Well done, especially considering the personal challenges you overcame! Keep up the great work.</p>
