Your project demonstrates a solid understanding of Bootstrap and responsive design principles. The navbar, table, form, and grid layouts are all implemented effectively. <br><br>💡 A few areas for improvement:<br>- Ensure the cards on the homepage stack vertically on small screens for full responsiveness<br>- Include more detail in your code walkthrough on the specific Bootstrap classes used<br>- Double check all pages for any minor functionality bugs<br><br>⭐ Your strengths really shone through in your well-organized GitHub repo and clear code structure. The README provided helpful context, and your commit history showed great progress. Keep up the awesome work!<br><br>🚀 To take this project to the next level, consider adding some JavaScript functionality to the form submission, and experiment with more advanced Bootstrap components like modals or carousels.<br><br>👏 You should be proud of what you accomplished with this project. I can tell you put a lot of thought and effort into it. Keep practicing and expanding your Bootstrap and responsive design skills. You're doing fantastic! Let me know if you have any other questions.<br><br>All the best,<br>Your Front-End Development Instructor
