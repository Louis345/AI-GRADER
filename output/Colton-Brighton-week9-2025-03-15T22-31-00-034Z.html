⚠️ The audio quality could be improved to ensure clear verbal explanations throughout
Score: 25/30</p><p>Total Score: 385/400 (96.25%)</p><p>Excellent work on this assignment, Colton! Your implementation of the War card game is solid and demonstrates a good understanding of JavaScript classes, methods, and game logic. The code is well-structured and functional.</p><p>I'm particularly impressed with your use of Mocha and Chai for unit testing the deck shuffling. This shows your ability to implement testing in your projects, which is a valuable skill.</p><p>To further enhance your submission, consider adding more detailed comments in your code to explain complex sections or key functionality. This will make your code even more readable and maintainable.</p><p>Additionally, while your video explanation covers the essential aspects of your project, the audio quality could be improved to ensure clarity throughout the entire video.</p><p>Overall, you've done an outstanding job on this assignment. Keep up the great work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance.</p><p>Best regards,
Your Instructor</p>
