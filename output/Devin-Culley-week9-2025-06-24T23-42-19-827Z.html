📊 Completion (<span class="score">140/160 points</span>)<br>✅ Great work using classes for Card, Deck, and Player to implement an object-oriented structure! This is a key part of the assignment.<br>✅ Your code successfully deals 26 cards to each player from a 52-card deck and iterates through all the rounds automatically. Well done!<br>⚠️ It looks like you compare card values properly to determine the winner of each round. However, I don't see explicit handling of ties. Make sure to account for that scenario and award zero points to both players in the case of a tie.<br>✅ Final scores are displayed accurately and the overall winner is declared. Nice job!<br>💯 The game runs automatically using console.log, which is perfect.<br><br>A few suggestions:<br>💡 Consider moving the <code>getValue</code> function outside the loop for better performance and code organization.<br>🌟 Think about adding some additional output to make the gameplay easier to follow, like announcing the winner of each round.<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">110/140 points</span>)  <br>✅ Your repository is set up properly on GitHub and the code is accessible.<br>⚠️ Adding some code comments, especially for complex logic like the card comparison, would help with code readability and maintenance. Try to explain key functionality.<br>⚠️ I didn't see a .gitignore file in your repository. It's a good practice to include one, especially to avoid tracking unnecessary files like node_modules.<br>👍 Your code is organized reasonably well with clear separation of the classes and game logic.<br>✨ Most of your variable and function names are clear and meaningful. Nicely done!<br><br>Some tips:<br>💡 Consider adding a README file to give an overview of your project and explain how to run the code.<br>🔨 Organizing the code into separate files for each class could further improve the structure.<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">60/70 points</span>)<br>🌟 Fantastic, your game runs without any major crashes or errors! <br>✅ All 26 rounds seem to execute properly, and the card dealing logic looks solid.<br>⚠️ Double check your point tracking logic, especially around ties. It's possible some edge cases aren't being handled as expected.<br>👏 No glaring logical errors that I can see - the overall game flow is implemented correctly.<br><br>A couple recommendations:<br>🛠️ Add some error handling, like checking for an empty deck before dealing cards, to make your code more robust.<br>💡 Implementing some unit tests could help catch any subtle bugs in the game logic.<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">20/30 points</span>)<br>✅ Your video does a good job showing the game running from start to finish. I can see the final results printed out.<br>⚠️ The code explanation could use a bit more depth. Try to focus on the most important parts of the logic and how the classes interact.<br>💡 I'd like to see a little more discussion of the OOP concepts you used and how they fit into the game design.<br>⚠️ The audio is a little hard to hear at times. Make sure to speak clearly and loudly enough to be easily understood.<br><br>Some suggestions for next time:<br>🔥 Spend a little more time highlighting the key parts of your code and explaining your design choices.<br>🚀 Practice your presentation ahead of time to work on pacing and clarity. You've got great content, it just needs some polishing!<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">330/400 points</span><br><br>Overall, this is a strong submission that demonstrates a good grasp of object-oriented programming concepts and JavaScript fundamentals. With a little more attention to detail around error handling, commenting, and explanation, this could be truly top-notch work. Keep up the great effort! 👏<br><br>Let me know if you have any other questions!
