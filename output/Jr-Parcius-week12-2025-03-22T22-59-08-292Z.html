      <p>Hi Jr Parcius,</p><p>I've reviewed your Week 12 API's and Fetch assignment and here's my evaluation of your work:</p><p>Completion (160/160): ✅
You've successfully implemented a CRUD application (without update) using json-server. Your code demonstrates proper use of fetch and async/await to interact with the API. The application allows adding and deleting books as required. Great job on completing all the core requirements!</p><p>GitHub (140/140): ✅ 
Your GitHub repository is set up correctly with the necessary files (index.html and index.js). The code is properly organized and formatted. I can easily understand the structure and purpose of your files. Well done on maintaining a clean and organized repository.</p><p>Errors/Functionality (60/70): ⚠️
Your application functions well overall, but there are a couple minor issues:
<li>The delete button is missing some margin or padding, causing it to appear too close to the book title. Consider adding some spacing for better visual separation.</li>
<li>After adding or deleting a book, the form input field still contains the previous value. It would be better to clear the input field after each successful operation.</li>
Apart from these small improvements, your application runs smoothly without any major errors.</p><p>Video (25/30): ⚠️
Your video walkthrough covers all the essential parts of your code and demonstrates the functionality of your application. However, the audio quality could be improved as there's some background noise/echo which makes it a bit harder to hear your explanations clearly. Consider recording in a quieter environment or using a microphone for better audio quality in your future videos.</p><p>Total Score: 385/400 (96.25%)</p><p>You've done an excellent job on this assignment, Jr Parcius! Your code is well-structured, and your application meets all the main requirements. To take your project to the next level, consider enhancing the UI styling, clearing the form input after operations, and improving your video audio quality.</p><p>Keep up the great work, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance. I'm here to support your learning journey.</p><p>Best regards,
Your Instructor</p>
