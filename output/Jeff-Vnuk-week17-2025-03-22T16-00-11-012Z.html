      <h1>Final Coding Project Evaluation</h1>
      <h2>Student: Jeff Vnuk</h2>
      <p>Week 17</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="content-to-copy">
      <p>Here is my evaluation of your final coding project based on the rubric and assignment description:</p><p>Completion (320 points):
✅ All required elements from the assignment description are present in the submitted code. The React application connects to an API and includes CRUD operations as specified. Full points awarded.</p><p>GitHub (280 points):  
✅ The provided GitHub repository link is functional and contains the complete React project code. All required files are present. Full points awarded.</p><p>Errors/Functionality (140 points):
✅ The application runs without any errors in the console or UI. CRUD operations all function properly to create, read, update and delete data via the API. Some minor things like improved error handling could be implemented, but overall the core functionality is solid. Assigning 130/140 points.</p><p>Video (60 points):
✅ The provided YouTube transcript demonstrates a complete walkthrough of the application's functionality. All key features are shown working properly.
⚠️ The actual video presentation could be improved by preparing an organized script in advance and rehearsing the demo a couple times to smooth out the flow. But the content itself covers everything required. Assigning 50/60 points for room for improvement in delivery.</p><p>Total Score: 780 / 800 points (97.5%)</p><p>Really excellent work overall, Jeff! This is a very complete and well-executed React project that demonstrates strong understanding of the key concepts - components, state management, data flow, API integration, CRUD operations, routing, etc. </p><p>The code itself is cleanly organized, properly structured into components, and follows best practices. Using TypeScript is also a big plus for maintainability.</p><p>For future consideration, I'd suggest adding some more sophisticated error handling, especially around the API calls. And for the video demos, doing a little script preparation and practice ahead of time will make the presentation flow more smoothly to really showcase your great work.</p><p>But overall this is top-notch work that fully satisfies the core objectives. You should be very proud of this project as a portfolio piece demonstrating your React skills. Keep up the fantastic work!</p><p>Let me know if you have any other questions.
