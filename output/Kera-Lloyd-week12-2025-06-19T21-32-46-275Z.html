    <p><strong>Week 12:</strong> API's and Fetch</p>
    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of your API's and Fetch assignment:<br><br>üìä Completion (<span class="score">120/160 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ Great job using fetch API to retrieve data from the json-server! Your GET requests are working well.<br>‚úÖ Async/await is implemented properly to handle the asynchronous API calls. Nice work there! <br>‚ö†Ô∏è The Create (POST) functionality is mostly working. However, you're not clearing the form fields after submitting, so the same data gets re-submitted on page refresh. Make sure to reset the form after a successful POST.<br>‚úÖ The Read (GET) functionality is displaying the recipe data correctly. The recipes load on page start and after any CUD operations. <br>‚úÖ Delete functionality is working - clicking the Delete button removes the recipe from both the UI and json-server data.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è The form is properly connected to the API for creating recipes. Just remember to clear it after submission.<br>‚úÖ json-server is set up and working as your API. Good call using a db.json file to persist the data.<br><br>üìù GitHub (<span class="score">115/140 points</span>)  <br>‚úÖ Your GitHub repository is set up correctly and the link works. The repo name clearly identifies the project.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è The file structure is mostly logical, but you have some unnecessary files like package.json and package-lock.json since you're not using npm. Try to include only the essential files.<br>üí° The JavaScript code could use more comments, especially for the main functions. Well-commented code is easier to understand and maintain.<br>‚úÖ The README file provides good setup instructions for running the project locally. It explains the json-server setup clearly.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è The commit history is a bit sparse. More frequent commits with meaningful messages would better showcase your development process. Try committing after completing each major feature or fix.<br><br>üìà Errors (<span class="score">60/70 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ No major errors in the console during testing, which is great! The app runs smoothly.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è The CRUD operations mostly work, but there's a small bug with the form not clearing after creating a recipe. This can lead to duplicate submissions. Make sure to reset the form fields.<br>üí° There's no error handling for failed API calls. Consider adding some try/catch blocks to gracefully handle any errors.<br>‚úÖ Async/await is used correctly without any synchronization issues. The code flow is easy to follow.<br>‚úÖ The UI updates correctly after each CUD operation, providing immediate feedback to the user.<br><br>üì± Video Explanation (<span class="score">20/30 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ Your video provides a decent overview of the project functionality. We can see the app running.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è The explanation could be more detailed in places. Spend a bit more time discussing your code design decisions and any challenges faced.<br>üí° The audio quality makes it a bit hard to understand in places. Consider recording in a quieter environment or using a better microphone if possible. <br>‚ö†Ô∏è The code walkthrough is pretty quick. Slow down and take time to explain the key parts of your JavaScript code and how they interact with the API.<br><br>üåü Total Score: <span class="score">315/400 points</span><br><br>Overall, this is a solid attempt at the assignment! Your core functionality is working, and you've integrated with the json-server API successfully. The main areas to work on are:<br>1) Resetting the form after creating a recipe <br>2) More robust error handling for API calls<br>3) Cleaning up the GitHub repo and improving the commit history<br>4) Providing clearer explanations and better audio in your video<br><br>Keep up the good work! Let me know if you have any other questions. üëç
