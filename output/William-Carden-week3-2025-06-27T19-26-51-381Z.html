    <hr>
📊 Completion (<span class="score">22/30 points</span>)<br>✅ You implemented several key Bootstrap components, including a navbar, table with styling, and a form. This shows a solid understanding of Bootstrap's capabilities.<br>⚠️ However, to receive full points, the project needed multiple pages and clearer evidence of responsive design. Consider adding more distinct pages and testing responsiveness at various breakpoints.<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">5/25 points</span>)  <br>⚠️ Unfortunately, I was unable to access your GitHub repository to evaluate the code and commits. The link resulted in a 404 error.<br>💡 Double check that the repository is public and the link you provided is correct. A well-organized GitHub repository is essential for collaboration and code review.<br>🔨 For future projects, make sure to include a descriptive README file outlining the project and how to run it. Frequent commits documenting your progress are also important.<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">12/15 points</span>)<br>✅ From the video demonstration, the website appears to function without any major errors. The links between pages work correctly.<br>⚠️ However, without access to the code, I couldn't fully test for valid HTML/CSS or proper usage of Bootstrap classes. Some minor deductions here due to the inability to thoroughly review the codebase.<br>💡 When recording your video, consider zooming in on the code so it's more readable. This makes it easier to spot any potential errors or areas for improvement.<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">7/10 points</span>)<br>👏 Your video provided a decent overview of the website's functionality. You explained the key components and demonstrated the user flow.<br>⚠️ For full points, aim to discuss your design choices in more depth. Explain why you structured the pages as you did and any challenges you faced during development.<br>🌟 Your presentation skills are developing nicely! Keep practicing and you'll be a pro in no time.<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">46/80 points</span><br><br>💪 Overall, this is a solid start on working with Bootstrap! You've demonstrated an understanding of several key features and how to structure a multi-page website.<br><br>🚀 To take your skills to the next level, focus on refining your GitHub workflow and expanding your use of Bootstrap's responsive grid system. Don't be afraid to experiment with more advanced components as well.<br><br>Keep up the great work, William! You're making excellent progress. 👍 Let me know if you have any other questions!
