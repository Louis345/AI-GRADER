    <hr>
üìä Completion (<span class="score">24/30 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ You created a website with multiple pages as required, including a home page, menu, and contact page. Great work! <br>‚úÖ The Bootstrap navbar is implemented correctly and collapses responsively on smaller screens. Well done.<br>‚úÖ You included nicely styled Bootstrap tables on the menu page with clear formatting. Excellent!<br>‚ö†Ô∏è The contact form looks good but is missing a few advanced Bootstrap classes and validation. Consider adding things like input validation, help text, error states, etc. to take it to the next level.<br>‚úÖ The design is responsive and elements stack vertically on small screens as expected. Good job.<br><br>üìù GitHub (<span class="score">20/25 points</span>)  <br>‚úÖ The repository was created successfully and I can access all the files. <br>‚úÖ The file structure is well organized with HTML files in the root, images in a subfolder, and a CSS file. This is a logical setup.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è The README file is present but extremely bare bones. Consider adding more content to help others understand your project, like an overview of features, instructions to run it locally, screenshots, etc.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è There are only 3 commits in the entire repository. For a project of this size, I would expect to see commits broken up into more logical chunks as features were implemented. More granular commits make it easier to track your development progress and revert changes if needed.<br><br>üìà Errors (<span class="score">15/15 points</span>)<br>üåü I didn't find any console errors during my testing - great work! The code looks clean and runs smoothly.<br>‚úÖ All the navigation links work properly and lead to the expected pages. Nice job.<br>‚úÖ I ran the HTML through a validator and didn't see any major issues. The syntax looks good.<br>‚úÖ The Bootstrap classes are being used correctly from what I can see. The styling is being applied as expected.<br><br>üì± Video Explanation (<span class="score">7/10 points</span>)<br>‚ú® Your explanation covered all the key components of the site, including the navbar, tables, contact form and responsiveness. <br>üí° It would have been nice to have seen a little more depth on your design choices and the specific Bootstrap features you used. Don't be afraid to elaborate on the "why" behind your decisions!<br>‚ö†Ô∏è The video didn't show the actual interaction with the live site as much as I would have liked. In the future, consider doing more of a live demo in addition to showing the code.<br>üëç Despite the voice issues, your presentation was clear and easy to understand. I appreciate you pushing through to record the explanation!<br><br>üåü Total Score: <span class="score">66/80 points</span><br><br>You've done a really nice job implementing the core Bootstrap components for this project. The responsive navbar, styled tables, and contact form are all working well. The code looks clean and well structured too.<br><br>The main areas for improvement would be:<br>1. Flesh out the README with more detail <br>2. Make more granular commits to show your progress<br>3. Add some more advanced features to the contact form<br>4. Do a live demo of the finished product in your video<br><br>But overall this is a strong submission that meets all the key requirements. With a bit more polish and some extra features, this could easily be top marks. <br><br>Keep up the great work! Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions.
