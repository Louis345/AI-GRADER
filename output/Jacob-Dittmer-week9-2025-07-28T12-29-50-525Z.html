    <hr>
📊 Completion (<span class="score">150/160 points</span>)<br>✅ Excellent work implementing the War card game using OOP concepts! Your code uses classes for Card, Deck, and Player to structure the game logic. 👏 <br><br>The game successfully deals 26 cards to each player from a 52-card deck and automatically iterates through all the rounds. Points are awarded to the player with the higher card, and ties are handled appropriately. 🌟<br><br>Your code displays the final score and declares the winner using console.log output. The game runs automatically from start to finish. 💯<br><br>⚠️ To get full points, consider adding a Card class to further encapsulate card properties and behavior. But overall, fantastic job on the core functionality! 🔥<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">120/140 points</span>)  <br>✨ Your GitHub repository is set up properly and accessible. The code is generally well-organized and uses meaningful variable and function names. Including a .gitignore file to exclude node_modules is a best practice. 👍<br><br>💡 To improve, aim for more detailed comments explaining the purpose and functionality of key code sections. This will enhance the readability and maintainability of your code. Also, consider organizing your files into directories (e.g., src/, tests/) as your project grows. <br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">70/70 points</span>)<br>🎉 Fantastic job on error-free functionality! The game runs without any crashes or errors. All 26 rounds are played correctly, and the card dealing works as intended. Point tracking is accurate with no logical errors in the game flow. 🚀<br><br>Your attention to detail and thorough testing have paid off in a smooth, error-free gaming experience. Keep up the great work! 💪<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">25/30 points</span>)<br>👏 Your video walkthrough does an excellent job demonstrating the game running from start to finish. It's clear that you put effort into explaining how the code works, particularly the logic for shuffling the deck. <br><br>⚠️ To get full points, try to dive a bit deeper into the OOP concepts used, such as why you chose certain class structures and how they interact. A few more code highlights and explanations of key design decisions would further showcase your understanding.<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">365/400 points</span><br><br>✨ Overall, this is an impressive implementation of the War card game! Your code demonstrates a solid grasp of JavaScript and OOP principles. The game runs smoothly, and your video explanation is informative. <br><br>💡 To take your project to the next level, consider adding more detailed code comments, expanding your video explanation to cover OOP concepts in greater depth, and possibly implementing unit tests using Mocha/Chai for bonus points.<br><br>👍 Keep up the fantastic work, and happy coding! You're well on your way to mastering full-stack development. If you have any questions or need further guidance, don't hesitate to reach out. 🚀
