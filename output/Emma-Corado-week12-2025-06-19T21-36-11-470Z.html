    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of the assignment based on the provided rubric:<br><br>üìä Completion (<span class="score">140/160 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ Fetch API is used to retrieve data from the JSON server <br>‚úÖ Async/await is implemented properly to handle asynchronous API calls<br>‚úÖ Create (POST) functionality is working to add new exercises<br>‚úÖ Read (GET) functionality displays the list of exercises <br>‚úÖ Delete functionality allows removing exercises<br>‚úÖ The form is properly connected to the API to submit new exercises<br>‚úÖ json-server is used as the API backend<br><br>‚ö†Ô∏è One piece that seems to be missing is the Update functionality, but the rubric states that is optional. Including Update would make this a full CRUD app. But overall, great work on implementing the core functionality! The code looks clean and well-structured. <br><br>üìù GitHub (<span class="score">125/140 points</span>)  <br>‚úÖ GitHub repository is properly created and accessible<br>‚úÖ File structure is logical with separate HTML, CSS, and JS files<br>‚úÖ Code is clean and follows good formatting conventions<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Some code comments would be helpful to explain key sections<br>‚ö†Ô∏è README file is quite minimal - adding more details about the project setup, dependencies, and how to run it would be useful<br><br>Overall the GitHub repository is in good shape, just a few areas that could use a bit more detail and explanation. Keep up the great organization!<br><br>üìà Errors (<span class="score">70/70 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ App runs without any console errors <br>‚úÖ Create, Read, and Delete operations all work correctly<br>‚úÖ Errors are handled gracefully - form will not submit if fields are missing<br>‚úÖ Async/await is used properly without any errors or race conditions<br>‚úÖ UI updates correctly when exercises are added or deleted<br><br>Fantastic work, the app runs smoothly without any errors! The functionality is solid and error-free. Asynchronous code can be tricky but you've handled it well.<br><br>üì± Video Explanation (<span class="score">25/30 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ Clearly explains the core functionality of creating, reading and deleting exercises<br>‚úÖ Demonstrates the CRUD operations by adding and deleting exercise entries <br>‚ö†Ô∏è Could use a little more detail on the API integration and how the frontend and backend interact<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Code walkthrough is a bit brief - going into more depth on key code snippets would be helpful<br><br>The video does a nice job showing the app in action and explaining the main features. Going into a little more technical detail would help demonstrate your understanding even further. But overall, good work!<br><br>üåü Total Score: <span class="score">360/400 points</span><br><br>You've built an impressive exercise tracking application! The core functionality is all in place and working properly. You have a solid foundation here.<br><br>To take it to the next level, consider adding:<br>- üî® Update functionality to allow editing exercises<br>- üí° More detailed code comments explaining key sections<br>- üìù Expanded README with project setup and dependency info<br>- üé• Deeper explanation in video of how frontend and backend communicate<br><br>But you should be proud of what you've accomplished! You've demonstrated strong skills in HTML/CSS/JS, API integration, and asynchronous programming. Keep up the fantastic work! üöÄ
