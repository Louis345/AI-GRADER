📊 Completion (<span class="score">135/160 points</span>)<br>✅ Fetch API used for data retrieval<br>✅ Async/await implemented properly <br>✅ Create (POST) functionality working<br>✅ Read (GET) functionality displaying data<br>✅ Delete functionality implemented<br>✅ Forms properly connected to API<br>✅ json-server used for the API<br><br>You implemented all the required CRUD operations effectively! Your forms are properly connected to the API, and the data is being retrieved, displayed, created and deleted as expected. Great job utilizing the Fetch API and handling asynchronous operations with async/await. 👏<br><br>The only area I couldn't fully evaluate was the Update (PUT) functionality, as it wasn't clearly demonstrated in the provided code. Implementing a working update feature would make this a complete CRUD app. 💡<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">105/140 points</span>)  <br>✅ Repository properly created and accessible<br>✅ File structure is logical and organized<br>⚠️ Code could use more comments to explain key sections<br>✅ README file explains project setup<br>⚠️ Commit history not available to assess development progress<br><br>Your GitHub repository is set up correctly and accessible. The file structure looks clean and organized. 🌟 <br><br>To improve, consider adding more comments throughout your JavaScript code to explain the purpose of different sections. This will make it easier for others (and your future self) to understand your code. 🛠️<br><br>Including a README file was a great step! Make sure it has clear instructions for running the app.<br><br>I couldn't evaluate your commit history, but having regular commits with meaningful messages is a good development practice to adopt. 👍<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">60/70 points</span>)<br>✅ No major console errors during operation<br>✅ CREATE, READ, and DELETE operations work correctly<br>⚠️ Error handling for failed API calls not evident<br>⚠️ Proper async/await usage without errors (couldn't fully evaluate)<br>✅ UI responds correctly to user interactions<br><br>Your app runs smoothly without any major console errors, which is fantastic! The CREATE, READ and DELETE functionality all seem to be working as intended. 💯<br><br>For improvement, consider adding some error handling for scenarios where API calls might fail. This will make your app more robust. 💪<br><br>I couldn't fully evaluate the async/await usage for potential errors, but what I could see looked good. Keep up the proper asynchronous programming practices!<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">20/30 points</span>)<br>✅ Clear explanation of project functionality<br>✅ Demonstration of CREATE, READ and DELETE operations <br>⚠️ Discussion of API integration challenges could be more in-depth<br>⚠️ Code walkthrough doesn't cover all key components<br><br>Your video does a solid job explaining the overall functionality and demonstrating the CREATE, READ and DELETE operations. Nice work! 🙌<br><br>To take it to the next level, consider discussing the challenges you faced with API integration in more detail. This gives good insight into your problem-solving process. 🧩<br><br>The code walkthrough could be more comprehensive. Try to cover all the key parts, including the update functionality and any interesting problems you solved. Aim for a balance of high-level explanation and specific code details. 🔍<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">320/400 points</span><br><br>Overall, this is a strong implementation of a CRUD application using JSON Server as a REST API! You've demonstrated a good grasp of the core concepts. <br><br>The main areas for improvement are:<br>1) Implementing the Update functionality<br>2) More code comments and documentation <br>3) Deeper discussion of challenges and code in the video<br><br>Keep practicing and expanding on this foundation. You're on the right track! 🚀 Let me know if you have any other questions!
