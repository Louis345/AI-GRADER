      <p><strong>Week 12:</strong> API's and Fetch</p>
      <hr />
      Hi Adam,<br /><br />Thank you for submitting your Week 12 API's and Fetch
      assignment. I've reviewed your code and have some feedback for you.
      <br /><br />‚ö†Ô∏è The main issue I noticed is that there doesn't appear to be
      any real API integration in your code. For this assignment, the critical
      requirement was to implement CRUD operations that actually interact with a
      real API endpoint using fetch or axios. However, I wasn't able to find any
      API calls in the files you submitted.<br /><br />As a result, the key CRUD
      operations are missing:<br />‚ùå GET/READ from API <br />‚ùå POST/CREATE to
      API<br />‚ùå DELETE from API<br />‚ùå Forms posting data to API<br /><br />Without
      the core API functionality, the maximum score for the Completion section
      is <span class="score">40/160 points</span>.<br /><br />Looking at your
      GitHub repository:<br />‚úÖ The repository exists and I was able to access
      it<br />‚úÖ A package.json file is included<br />‚ùå However, the main
      application file (week12.js based on package.json) and component files
      appear to be missing. The repository should contain all the files needed
      to run your application.<br />üí° I'd suggest adding a README that explains
      how to set up and interact with the API for your app. A good commit
      history documenting your development process is also recommended.<br /><br />Since
      the main app files were not found, I was unable to assess the code
      functionality, error handling, and proper use of async/await or promises.
      Including those files on GitHub is necessary for full credit.<br /><br />Lastly,
      I noticed you did not include a video walkthrough of your application. The
      video is an important part of the submission to demonstrate the CRUD
      operations working with the API. Consider recording a brief walkthrough
      next time that shows the API calls being made and the results in your
      app.<br /><br />I know working with APIs can be challenging, but I
      encourage you to keep practicing and reach out if you need any help! Focus
      on getting those API endpoints connected and your CRUD operations
      functional. I'm confident you'll get there with a bit more effort. Let me
      know if you have any questions!<br /><br />Best regards,<br /><br />JT
