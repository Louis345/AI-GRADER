📊 Completion (<span class="score">20/30 points</span>)<br>✅ You created multiple pages for your Bootstrap website - great job! The inclusion of crops and livestock sections shows good progress. 👍<br>⚠️ However, I didn't see clear evidence of properly styled tables or Bootstrap form classes in the video. Make sure to implement these fully to meet all the requirements. <br>💡 Adding more Bootstrap components like cards, accordions, or a carousel could really enhance your pages further!<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">5/25 points</span>)  <br>⚠️ I was unable to properly evaluate your GitHub repository because the provided URL gave an error. Double check that the repo is public and the link is correct.<br>💡 In the future, make sure to commit your files regularly to GitHub so your development progress is clearly visible. Aim to include a helpful README file outlining the project as well.<br>🛠️ Organizing your code files into logical folders (like /css, /js, /img) can make your repo more maintainable as it grows.<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">10/15 points</span>)<br>✅ From what I could see in the video, your website loaded without any glaring errors - nice work!<br>⚠️ I couldn't fully test all the links or validate the HTML/CSS without access to the code repository. Keep an eye out for any console errors or broken links once your repo is working.<br>🔨 When you implement the tables and forms, double check that you're applying Bootstrap classes correctly to ensure proper styling and functionality.<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">8/10 points</span>)<br>👏 Fantastic work recording your first explanation video! You gave a solid overview of several elements of your website, like the flex container, navbar, and pages. <br>💡 For an even stronger presentation next time, try to go into more detail about your specific design choices, any challenges you faced, and how you implemented each feature. Aim for a clear, confident speaking style.<br>✨ With a bit more practice, I'm confident your videos will become ultra professional and engaging! Keep up the great effort.<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">43/80 points</span><br><br>Overall, this is a promising start to your Bootstrap website! 🚀 I can see you've put in solid effort to implement multiple pages and components. To take it to the next level, focus on adding in those tables and forms, and make sure your GitHub repository is properly set up so I can evaluate the code fully. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions - I'm here to help you succeed! 💪 Keep up the coding momentum, you've got this! 🌟
