    <p><strong>Week 9:</strong> JavaScript Unit Final Coding Project - WAR Card Game</p>
    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of Mayte's WAR Card Game project:<br><br>üìä Completion (<span class="score">160/160 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ Excellent work implementing the core functionality of the WAR card game using JavaScript classes! Your Card, Deck, and Player classes demonstrate a strong grasp of object-oriented programming principles. The game deals cards properly, iterates through all 26 rounds, tracks points accurately, and declares a winner. <br>üëè I'm impressed with how you automated the entire game flow using console.log() statements to display each turn. This allows the game to run to completion without any user input. <br>üåü You've met all the key requirements of the assignment brief and delivered a fully functional, well-structured WAR card game. Fantastic job!<br><br>üìù GitHub (<span class="score">140/140 points</span>)  <br>üíØ Your GitHub repository is set up correctly and the provided link works. The code is professionally formatted and well-commented, clearly explaining the purpose of each class and key functions.<br>‚ú® Excellent work including a .gitignore file to avoid tracking unnecessary files like node_modules. Your variable and function names are clear and meaningful, making the code easy to follow.<br>üî• The repository has a logical structure and all the essential files for the project. I can tell you put a lot of thought into organizing your code.<br><br>üìà Errors (<span class="score">60/70 points</span>)<br>üëç For the most part, your game runs smoothly without any major crashes or errors. The card dealing logic works great, and the point tracking seems accurate across multiple test runs.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è However, I did notice one small bug: the ranks of the cards are off by one. Since you're using the array index + 2 to set the rank, your cards actually range from 2 to 14 (with Ace as 14), rather than the standard 2 to 13 with Ace as 1. This doesn't break the game but it's semantically incorrect and could lead to unintuitive outcomes like an Ace beating a King.<br>üí° To fix this, I suggest changing your logic slightly so that the card ranks are assigned correctly. Either modify the numeric rank formula to use the index + 1, or reorder your ranks array to have the Ace first.<br><br>üì± Video Explanation (<span class="score">25/30 points</span>)<br>üôå Thank you for submitting a video walkthrough of your code! The screenshare is clear and I can follow along with your explanation of each class and key function. <br>üöÄ You highlighted the most important parts of your implementation, like the card dealing, game loop, and winner declaration. This demonstrates a solid understanding of your own code and the core assignment requirements.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è The main area for improvement here is the audio quality. There's quite a bit of background noise and echo which makes it a little hard to hear you at times. Consider recording in a quieter space or using a headset microphone if you have one.<br><br>üåü Total Score: <span class="score">385/400 points</span><br><br>Overall this is outstanding work, Mayte! You've built a complete, functional WAR card game that demonstrates a strong command of object-oriented JavaScript programming. The core game logic is solid, your code is well-organized and readable, and you've met all the key deliverables.<br><br>The only significant issue I found was the small bug with the card rank values. With a slight tweak to the Card constructor logic, you'll have a fully accurate game. <br><br>To take this project to the next level, consider adding some extra features like a leaderboard using localStorage, UI/UX improvements with HTML/CSS, or using unit tests to verify each class. But even without those extras, you've done a fantastic job here. Keep up the great work! üëè<br><br>Let me know if you have any other questions!
