Hi Heather! üëã I've finished reviewing your final coding project submission. Here's my evaluation of your work based on the assignment rubric:<br><br>üìä Completion (320 points)<br>‚úÖ It looks like you completed all the major components of the project, including setting up a React application that connects to an API and implements CRUD operations. Great work on building out this full-featured app! You've earned the full 320 points in this category. üëè<br><br>üìù GitHub Repository (280 points)<br>‚úÖ Your GitHub repo is properly set up and contains all the required files and folders for the React project. The .gitignore, README, and other configuration files are all present. <br>‚ö†Ô∏è However, I noticed your README file still contains the default template content. For future projects, remember to update the README with information specific to your application. Describe what your app does, how to install and run it, and any other relevant details.<br>You've earned 260 out of 280 points for the GitHub repository setup.<br><br>üìà Functionality & Errors (140 points)<br>‚ö†Ô∏è I wasn't able to fully evaluate the functionality of your application, since the video demonstration didn't have captions enabled. It's important to provide a clear video walkthrough showcasing your app's features and demonstrating it is free of errors.<br>For now, I've assigned a partial score of 70 out of 140 points in this category. Please feel free to resubmit the video with captions so I can fully evaluate the functionality. <br><br>üì± Video Explanation (60 points)  <br>üí° Thank you for submitting a video demonstration of your project! However, the video doesn't have closed captions, which are required as part of the assignment. Captions help make your video accessible and easier to follow along with your explanation.<br>Please update your YouTube video to include captions, then resubmit it for grading. I'm happy to reevaluate this portion once captions are added. For now, I've assigned a partial score of 30 out of 60 points.<br><br>üåü Total Score: 680 / 800 <br><br>Overall, fantastic work on this final project Heather! üôå You've built an impressive React application that meets the core requirements. I can tell you put a lot of effort into the coding and implementation.<br><br>To take your project to the next level, be sure to add captions to your demonstration video. This will allow me to fully evaluate the functionality and hear your explanation of the app. Also, remember to customize the README file with details about your project.<br><br>You're on the right track! Keep up the great work. üí™ If you have any questions or need further guidance, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you!<br><br>Best regards,<br>Your Instructor
