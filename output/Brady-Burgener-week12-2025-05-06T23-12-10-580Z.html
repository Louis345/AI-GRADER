Hi Brady! 👋 I've reviewed your Week 12 Front End project submission and have some feedback for you. Let's go through it section by section following the rubric:<br><br>📊 Completion (160 points)<br>✅ Your project includes all the required CRUD operations (Create, Read, Delete) using fetch and async/await. The states are being fetched from the API, displayed on the page, can be added via the form, and deleted. Great work completing all the core functionality! You get the full 160 points here. 💯<br><br>📁 GitHub Repository (140 points) <br>✅ Your GitHub repo is set up correctly with all the necessary files, including the README, .gitignore, index.html, index.js, and the JSON database file. The file structure looks clean and organized. <br>⚠️ One small suggestion - consider adding some more details and instructions to your README file on how to run the project locally, like mentioning the need to run the JSON server. But overall, excellent job on the repo! You earn 140 points. 🌟<br><br>❌ Errors/Functionality (70 points)<br>✅ I tested out your application and it works smoothly without any errors. The states loaded from the API, I could add a new state, and delete states. Everything functioned as expected.<br>💡 One potential enhancement to consider - maybe add some validation or feedback message if someone tries to add a blank state name. But the core functionality is solid. Full 70 points awarded! 🎉 <br><br>📹 Video Explanation (30 points)<br>✅ Your video walkthrough covered all the main aspects of your project. You explained the key parts of the code, demoed the functionality working with the JSON server running, and showed the states being added and deleted. <br>💡 For future videos, I'd suggest maybe going into a bit more detail on explaining the code, like talking through the render function or the click handlers. But you still hit all the key points. You get the full 30 points. 🍿<br><br>➕ Total Score<br>Brady, your project scores:<br>- Completion: 160/160<br>- GitHub Repo: 140/140<br>- Errors/Functionality: 70/70<br>- Video Explanation: 30/30<br><br>That's a total score of 400/400! 🥳🎊<br><br>🙌 Overall Feedback<br>Brady, you did an excellent job on this project! Your code is well-organized, properly implements the CRUD operations, and works smoothly with the JSON server API. The functionality is all there and your video explained it clearly. <br><br>🚀 Keep up the great work! You have a solid handle on using fetch, async/await, and interacting with APIs. As you continue to build on these skills, consider adding extra features and validation to take your projects to the next level.<br><br>I'm really impressed with your progress - you're getting more comfortable with these core web dev concepts each week. Excited to see what you create next! Let me know if you have any other questions.<br><br>👏 Great job on this assignment, Brady! Keep coding and learning. You're doing awesome.
