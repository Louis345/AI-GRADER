Your code is well-structured, uses hooks effectively, and integrates well with the API. The routing adds a nice multi-page flow to the application. <br><br>You clearly demonstrated strong understanding of React concepts like hooks, props, state management, and JSX. Your components are organized logically and the data flow between them is handled properly. Error handling for the API calls is also implemented well.<br><br>I love that you added clear comments explaining key parts of the code. That will help with maintainability. Your GitHub repository is set up perfectly and the project runs smoothly on my end after cloning it. <br><br>The video explanation was top-notch! You covered all aspects of the project, provided insightful explanations of your implementation approach, and gave a great demo of the app in action. Well done!<br><br>Overall, this is a fantastic culmination of your React learning journey. You've demonstrated excellence in every aspect of the project. Keep up the great work and I'm excited to see what you'll build next with your skills! Let me know if you have any other questions. 👍
