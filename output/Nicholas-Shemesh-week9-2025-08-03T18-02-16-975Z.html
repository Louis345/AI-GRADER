    <hr>
📊 Completion (<span class="score">150/160 points</span>)<br>✅ Great job using classes for Card, Deck, and Player to structure your code in an object-oriented way! 💯<br>✅ Your game successfully deals 26 cards to each player from a 52-card deck and iterates through all rounds automatically. 🌟 <br>✅ Points are awarded correctly to the player with the higher card each round, with ties handled appropriately. 👍<br>✅ The final score is displayed and a winner is declared at the end. Nice work! 🔥<br>⚠️ While the game runs well using console.log output, implementing a basic UI could make it even more engaging for players. Consider this for a future enhancement! 💡<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">100/140 points</span>)  <br>✅ Your GitHub repository is set up properly and the code is accessible. Good job! 👏<br>⚠️ Adding more comments throughout your code explaining the functionality of each section would make it easier for others (and your future self) to understand. 🛠️<br>✅ You included an index.html file, but I don't see a .gitignore file in the repository. Make sure to add that to avoid tracking unnecessary files. 💡<br>✅ Your code structure is clean and organized, with meaningful variable and function names. Well done! 🌟<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">70/70 points</span>)<br>🌟 Fantastic work - your game runs without any crashes or errors! 💯<br>✅ All 26 rounds play through correctly, with card dealing and point tracking working as expected. 🚀 <br>✅ I don't see any logical errors in the game flow. Everything looks great! 👍<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">25/30 points</span>)<br>✅ Your video does an excellent job demonstrating the game running from start to finish. Nice work! 👏<br>✅ You explain how the code works and highlight key portions, showing a solid understanding of the concepts. 🔥<br>⚠️ Elaborating a bit more on how the OOP concepts are applied in your code would help showcase your knowledge even further. 💡<br>✅ Your screen share and voice over are clear and easy to follow. Well done! 🌟<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">345/400 points</span><br><br>Overall, this is an impressive implementation of the War card game using JavaScript and OOP principles. Your code is well-structured, error-free, and produces the expected results. Adding some more code comments and expanding on the OOP concepts in your video would take this project to the next level. <br><br>Keep up the great work, Nikki! You've demonstrated a strong grasp of JavaScript fundamentals and object-oriented programming. I'm confident you'll continue to build even more exciting projects in the future. Happy coding! 🚀✨
