📊 Completion (<span class="score">120/160 points</span>)<br>✅ Fetch API used for data retrieval<br>✅ Async/await implemented properly <br>✅ Create (POST) functionality working<br>✅ Read (GET) functionality displaying data<br>✅ Delete functionality implemented<br>⚠️ Forms not fully connected to API (-20 points)<br>✅ json-server or alternative API used<br><br>Nice job implementing the core CRUD functionality using fetch and async/await! Your code successfully retrieves, creates, and deletes house data from the API. 👏<br><br>One area for improvement is fully connecting the forms to the API. It looks like the update form is not fully wired up to send the updated data to the API. Make sure all form inputs are properly linked to the corresponding API actions. 💡<br><br>Keep up the solid work on the API integration! With a bit more polish on the form connections, you'll have a fully functional CRUD app. 💪<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">140/140 points</span>)  <br>✅ Repository properly created and accessible<br>✅ File structure is logical and organized<br>✅ Code is clean and well-commented<br>✅ README file explains project setup<br>✅ Commit history shows development progress<br><br>Excellent job setting up your GitHub repository! 🌟 Your repo is accessible and well-organized, making it easy to navigate and understand your project structure. <br><br>Your code is clean, readable, and includes helpful comments explaining key functionality. 👍 The README file provides a clear overview of the project and its setup.<br><br>It's great to see your commit history reflecting steady progress throughout the development process. 📈 Keep up the version control best practices!<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">60/70 points</span>)<br>✅ No console errors during operation<br>✅ All CRUD operations work correctly<br>⚠️ Error handling for failed API calls (-10 points)<br>✅ Proper async/await usage without errors<br>✅ UI responds correctly to user interactions<br><br>Your app runs smoothly without any console errors, which is fantastic! 🎉 All the CRUD operations - create, read, update, delete - are functioning as expected.<br><br>One suggestion would be to add more robust error handling for failed API calls. It's important to anticipate and handle scenarios where the API may be unresponsive or returns an error. Consider adding try/catch blocks or <code>.catch()</code> handlers to gracefully handle any API errors and provide user feedback. 🛠️<br><br>Your proper usage of async/await ensures that asynchronous operations are handled correctly, avoiding potential errors. 👏 The UI responds well to user interactions, providing a smooth experience.<br><br>Keep up the great work on error-free functionality! With a bit more error handling, your app will be even more resilient. 💪<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">0/30 points</span>)<br>⚠️ No video explanation submitted<br><br>Note: The video explanation was not submitted for this assignment, so I did not evaluate it. I adjusted the total score accordingly.<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">320/370 points</span><br><br># Overall Feedback<br>Great job on this assignment, Sermon! 🎉 Your CRUD app demonstrates a solid understanding of API integration using fetch and async/await. You've successfully implemented the core functionality of creating, reading, updating, and deleting house data from the API.<br><br>Your GitHub repository is well-organized and your code is clean and well-documented. It's clear you put effort into structuring your project and following best practices. 👏<br><br>To take your project to the next level, focus on fully connecting the forms to the API and adding more robust error handling. These improvements will enhance the user experience and make your app more resilient.<br><br>Although you didn't submit a video explanation, your code and repository speak for themselves. Keep up the fantastic work and continue honing your API integration skills! 🚀<br><br>If you have any questions or need further guidance, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support your learning journey. 😊<br><br>Keep coding with passion and dedication! 👨‍💻👩‍💻
