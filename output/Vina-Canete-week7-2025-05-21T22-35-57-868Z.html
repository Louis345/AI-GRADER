    <p><strong>Week 7:</strong> JS4 - ECMA Script</p>
    <hr>
Hey there Vina! üëã I've had a chance to review your JS4 - ECMA Script assignment submission. Here's my evaluation and feedback for you. üìù<br><br>## GitHub Repository (40 points)<br>‚úÖ Your GitHub repo is set up correctly and contains the necessary files. Great job! (5 points)<br>‚ö†Ô∏è I noticed that you didn't include a README.md file in your repo. Adding one with an overview of the project and any setup instructions would be helpful. (2 out of 5 points)<br>‚úÖ Your HTML files are structured properly and use appropriate Bootstrap classes and components. Well done! (15 points) <br>‚úÖ The CSS file is present but empty. No points deducted since custom CSS wasn't a requirement, but feel free to explore adding your own styles too! (5 points)<br>‚úÖ Good use of a .gitignore file to exclude the node_modules directory. (5 points)<br><br><strong>GitHub Repository Score: 37/40</strong> üåü<br><br>## JavaScript Code (55 points)<br>‚ö†Ô∏è I didn't find any JavaScript code related to the ECMA Script requirements in your repo. It looks like you may have accidentally omitted those files, or perhaps they are still a work in progress. <br>Remember, the key focuses for this assignment were:<br>- [ ] Use of <code>let</code> and <code>const</code><br>- [ ] Template literals<br>- [ ] Arrow functions<br>- [ ] Default parameters<br>- [ ] Destructuring<br>- [ ] Async/Await<br><br>Since I wasn't able to evaluate your JavaScript code, I can't award any points in this category yet. But don't worry - you're still making good progress overall! üí™ <br>When you have a chance, try adding in some JavaScript files that demonstrate the ECMA Script concepts and re-submit. I'm happy to take another look and update your score.<br><br><strong>JavaScript Code Score: 0/55</strong><br><br>## Video Presentation (0 points)<br>For this assignment, you didn't submit a YouTube video walkthrough, so no points were allocated to this category. Let me know if you have any questions!<br><br>## Other Feedback<br>- Your Bootstrap implementation looks great so far! The navbar, forms, and other components are used effectively. üé®<br>- Nice work customizing the styles and layout to fit the pet adoption theme. The site has a friendly and inviting feel. üêæ<br>- I appreciate the concise and well-organized repo structure. It's easy to navigate and understand each file's purpose. üìÇ <br>- Excited to see your JavaScript skills in action once you add the ECMA Script concepts. Keep up the momentum! üöÄ<br><br>## <div class="total-score">Total Score: <span class="score">37/95</span></div><br>You're off to a strong start, Vina! The main area for improvement is adding in the JavaScript code to fulfill the ECMA Script requirements. <br>Once you have that in place, you'll be in great shape. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need guidance. üì£<br><br>I'm confident you'll do well as you continue working on this assignment. Keep up the solid effort! üòÑ<br><br>Let me know if there's anything else I can assist with.<br><br>All the best,<br>Your JavaScript Instructor üôå
