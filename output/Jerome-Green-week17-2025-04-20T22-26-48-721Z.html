Hi Jerome! üëã I've finished reviewing your final coding project submission. Let's go through the evaluation together, focusing on the GitHub code components. üìä<br><br>## Code Repository (280 points)<br>‚úÖ You successfully set up a GitHub repository for your project, meeting the basic requirements. The repository contains the necessary files and directories for a React application. Well done! üëè<br><br>Points awarded: 280/280<br><br>## React Application (320 points)<br>‚ö†Ô∏è While you've made a good start on the React application setup, there are a few key components missing that were specified in the assignment description:<br>- I don't see evidence of connecting to an API to fetch data<br>- The CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are not implemented<br>- The application structure could be expanded to demonstrate the concepts covered in class<br><br>To receive full points in this category, I'd like to see you integrate an API, add the CRUD functionality, and further build out the components and interactivity of the React app. Let's schedule some office hours to go over strategies for tackling these missing pieces! üí™<br><br>Points awarded: 200/320<br><br>## Functionality (140 points)<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Since the API integration and CRUD operations are not yet present, it's difficult to assess the full functionality of your application at this stage. I encourage you to focus on adding those key features, as they are essential to meeting the project requirements and showcasing your React skills. <br><br>I've awarded partial points for the groundwork you've laid so far with the basic React setup. Once you've incorporated the remaining functionality, I'll be happy to reassess this category. Keep up the effort! üöÄ<br><br>Points awarded: 70/140<br><br>## Video Presentation (60 points)<br>N/A - As noted, no video was submitted with this assignment. The 60 points allocated for the video presentation will not be included in the total score calculation.<br><br>## Total Score<br>‚ûï Calculating your total score:<br>- Code Repository: 280/280<br>- React Application: 200/320<br>- Functionality: 70/140<br>- Video Presentation: N/A<br><br>Total points earned: 550/740<br><br>## Summary<br>Jerome, you're off to a solid start with setting up the foundation for your React application! üåü However, there's still some work to be done to fully meet the project requirements. I recommend focusing on integrating an API, implementing CRUD operations, and expanding your application's components and interactivity. <br><br>Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need any clarification or guidance along the way. I'm here to support you and help you succeed! üí™ Let's schedule a 1:1 meeting to discuss your progress and strategize next steps. <br><br>Keep coding and stay positive! You've got this! üòÑ<br><br>Best regards,<br>Your Instructor
