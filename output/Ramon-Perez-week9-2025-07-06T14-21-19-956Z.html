    <p><strong>Week 9:</strong> JavaScript Unit Final Coding Project - WAR Card Game</p>
    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of Ramon's WAR card game project based on the provided rubric:<br><br>📊 Completion (<span class="score">145/160 points</span>)<br>✅ Ramon did a great job implementing the core game functionality using OOP concepts like classes for Card, Deck, and Player. His code effectively deals cards, iterates through rounds, awards points, and declares a winner. <br>⚠️ To get full points, Ramon could add some additional polish like displaying an intro message when the game starts and a "Play again?" prompt at the end. But overall, excellent work on the core requirements!<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">120/140 points</span>)  <br>✅ Ramon set up a well-organized GitHub repository that is accessible and includes all the necessary files.<br>👏 The code is nicely structured and makes good use of meaningful variable and function names. <br>💡 To maximize points in this category, Ramon should add some more detailed code comments, especially for the trickier game logic parts. A README file explaining how to run the game would also be helpful.<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">70/70 points</span>)<br>🌟 No errors or crashes observed - the game runs smoothly from start to finish. All the rounds play out correctly with cards being dealt properly and scores tracked accurately.  <br>💯 Fantastic work on the game flow and logic - everything behaves as expected with no bugs!<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">25/30 points</span>)<br>👍 Ramon does a nice job in his video demonstrating the game running from start to finish. <br>✨ He walks through the key parts of the code and shows a solid grasp of the OOP concepts used like classes, constructors, and inheritance.<br>💡 The video could be improved with a little better audio quality and by showing the mocha test results. But it meets the key criteria quite well.<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">360/400 points</span><br><br>Overall this is very impressive work, Ramon! You've clearly got a strong handle on JavaScript OOP fundamentals and should be really proud of how your WAR game turned out. Keep practicing those core skills and start thinking about how you could make this even more engaging, perhaps by adding a simple UI. But fantastic project here - you're well on your way to JavaScript mastery! 🚀<br><br>Let me know if you have any other questions!
