      Here is your evaluation of the student's assignment:<br /><br />üìä
      Completion (<span class="score">140/160 points</span>)<br />‚úÖ Fetch API
      used for data retrieval (20 points)<br />‚úÖ Async/await implemented
      properly (20 points)<br />‚úÖ Create (POST) functionality working (20
      points)<br />‚úÖ Read (GET) functionality displaying data (20 points)
      <br />‚úÖ Delete functionality implemented (20 points)<br />‚úÖ Forms
      properly connected to API (20 points)<br />‚úÖ json-server used as API (20
      points)<br />‚ö†Ô∏è Missing update (PUT) functionality (-20 points)<br /><br />Excellent
      work on implementing the core CRUD operations! Your code demonstrates
      proper use of fetch, async/await, and JSON server. The GET, POST, and
      DELETE are all working as expected. <br /><br />One area for improvement
      is to add the update/PUT functionality. This is a key part of CRUD and
      required for full points. Adding an edit form and ajax PUT request would
      round out the assignment. üí°<br /><br />üìù GitHub (<span class="score"
        >120/140 points</span
      >) <br />‚úÖ Repository properly created and accessible (20 points)<br />‚úÖ
      File structure is logical and organized (20 points)<br />‚úÖ Code is clean
      and well-commented (20 points)<br />‚ö†Ô∏è README file explains project setup
      but could use more detail (-20 points)<br />‚úÖ Commit history shows
      development progress (20 points)<br /><br />Your GitHub repo is set up
      correctly with all the necessary files. The code is tidy and includes
      helpful comments. <br /><br />The README has basic info but could be more
      thorough. Consider adding details on how to install dependencies, run the
      server, and use the app. A few screenshots could also enhance it. üåü<br /><br />üìà
      Errors (<span class="score">60/70 points</span>)<br />‚úÖ No console errors
      during operation (20 points)<br />‚úÖ All CRUD operations work correctly,
      except update (-10 points) <br />‚úÖ Error handling for failed API calls
      (10 points)<br />‚úÖ Proper async/await usage without errors (20 points)<br />‚úÖ
      UI responds correctly to user interactions (20 points)<br /><br />The app
      runs smoothly without any console errors, which is great! The implemented
      CRUD functions work reliably. Nice job adding error handling for API
      calls. <br /><br />As mentioned, the only thing missing is the update
      feature, but what you have works solidly. Async code is used correctly
      throughout. The interface is intuitive and responsive. üëè<br /><br />üì±
      Video Explanation (<span class="score">20/30 points</span>)<br />‚úÖ Clear
      explanation of project functionality (10 points)<br />‚ö†Ô∏è Demonstration of
      all CRUD operations - missing update (-5 points)<br />‚ö†Ô∏è Discussion of API
      integration challenges (-5 points)<br />‚úÖ Code walkthrough showing key
      components (10 points)<br /><br />The video gives a good overview of the
      app's features. You explain the key parts of the code clearly.
      <br /><br />To get full marks, make sure to showcase the update
      functionality once added. It would also be beneficial to discuss any
      challenges faced with the API integration and how you overcame them. üí™<br /><br />üåü
      Total Score: <span class="score">340/400 points</span><br /><br />You've
      done an excellent job on this assignment! The core functionality is there
      and the code is well-structured. <br /><br />The main things to work on
      are:<br />1) Implementing the update/PUT <br />2) Enhancing the README<br />3)
      Demonstrating the full CRUD in the video with commentary<br /><br />With
      those additions, this would be a top-notch project. Your coding skills are
      progressing nicely. Keep up the great work! üöÄ<br /><br />Let me know if
      you have any other questions!
