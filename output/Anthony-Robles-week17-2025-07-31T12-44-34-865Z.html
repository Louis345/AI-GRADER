üìä Completion (<span class="score">220/320 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ It's clear from your video explanation that you made a strong effort to implement all the key requirements of the project. Your React application successfully connects to a mock API and includes CRUD operations. <br>‚ö†Ô∏è However, without being able to review the actual code in the GitHub repository, I can't fully confirm that every requirement was attempted. I'll award partial credit here based on what I could glean from the video. Keep up the solid work!<br><br>üìù GitHub (<span class="score">80/280 points</span>)  <br>‚ö†Ô∏è Unfortunately, due to the GitHub repository access error, I was unable to clone or run your project code. This makes it difficult to assess the completeness of your file structure and repository organization.<br>üí° In the future, double check your repository settings and ensure that your project is accessible for evaluation. Consider adding detailed README instructions for cloning and running the project.<br>üëè I'm awarding partial credit because your video demonstrates that you do have a working project. Keep at it!<br><br>üìà Errors (<span class="score">70/140 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ From what I could observe in the video, your application appears to execute without any major errors. The CRUD features seem to be working as expected. <br>‚ö†Ô∏è However, without being able to run the code myself, I can't fully test the error handling or edge cases. There may be some minor issues that weren't apparent in the demo.<br>üöÄ Overall, your application looks solid from a functionality standpoint based on the video. Debug thoroughly to catch any remaining glitches!<br><br>üì± Video Explanation (<span class="score">60/60 points</span>)<br>üåü Fantastic job on the video walkthrough! Your explanation covered all the key aspects of the project requirements.<br>üëç I appreciated how you demonstrated the functionality of your application in action. The CRUD operations and navigation flow were clearly shown.<br>üíØ Your presentation was well-organized and easy to follow. The code structure breakdown was a helpful overview. <br>üí™ In the future, I'd love to see you elaborate a bit more on your problem-solving process and the specific challenges you overcame. But overall, excellent work on the video!<br><br>üåü Total Score: <span class="score">430/800 points</span><br><br>You should be proud of the hard work you put into this project! I can see the effort you made to implement the core requirements and explain your process.<br><br>The biggest limitation in my evaluation was the inaccessible GitHub repository. In the future, make sure to double check your repo settings and include detailed instructions for running the project. <br><br>From what I could assess based on the video, your React skills are developing well. Continue practicing connecting to APIs and implementing CRUD operations. With more experience, you'll be able to build even more robust applications.<br><br>Thank you for submitting your project, even with the repo challenges. Don't be discouraged, and keep coding! You've got great potential as a React developer. Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions!
