    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of the assignment:<br><br>📊 Completion (<span class="score">150/160 points</span>)<br>✅ Great use of console methods for debugging and displaying game output! The console.log statements clearly show the rounds, cards played, points, and final winner.<br>✅ Code runs successfully without any crashes or major errors.<br>⚠️ While the code is functional, there are a few areas that could be improved, such as adding more comments to explain complex logic and considering additional edge cases. <br>Overall, excellent work demonstrating your debugging skills! Just a few small improvements would make this code even stronger.<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">130/140 points</span>)  <br>✅ Code is well-organized into separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This makes the project structure very clear and easy to navigate.<br>✅ Files are named logically and consistently.<br>⚠️ README file provides assignment description but lacks examples of your debugging process and approach. Adding more details here would help showcase your problem-solving skills.<br>💡 Commit messages could be more descriptive to better convey the changes made in each commit. Try to summarize the key changes in each commit message.<br>Great job organizing your code on GitHub! Just expand your README a bit and use more informative commit messages to really highlight your work.<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">65/70 points</span>)<br>✅ No major bugs or unresolved errors found. Game runs smoothly from start to finish.<br>✅ Error handling is implemented to prevent invalid moves.<br>⚠️ Could add more robust error handling for potential issues like running out of cards or invalid user input.<br>💡 Consider adding a try/catch block to handle any unexpected errors gracefully.<br>You've done a good job ensuring the core functionality works without errors. Expanding your error handling a bit more would help make the code even more resilient.<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">0/30 points</span>)<br>⚠️ No video was submitted with this assignment. Make sure to include a video walkthrough in future assignments to explain your code and demonstrate its functionality.<br>The video portion is a great opportunity to show off your work and express your ideas. Aim to include it next time to get full credit!<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">345/370 points</span><br><br>You've done an excellent job overall on this assignment! 🙌 Your code runs well, implements the core game logic effectively, and demonstrates a solid grasp of JavaScript and GitHub. <br><br>Some key strengths:<br>👏 Well-structured code that's easy to read and understand<br>💯 Game mechanics work smoothly and produce the expected results<br>🔥 Effective use of classes and methods to organize the codebase<br><br>A few areas to work on for next time:<br>💡 Adding more detailed comments to explain your design choices<br>🛠️ Expanding error handling to cover additional edge cases<br>📝 Including a video walkthrough to showcase your work<br><br>Keep up the great work and happy coding! 🚀 Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
