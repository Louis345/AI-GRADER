Hey there Nicholas! 👋 I've reviewed your CRD app project and I'm excited to share my feedback with you. Let's dive in and see how you did! 🚀<br><br>📊 Completion (<span class="score">140/160 points</span>)<br>✅ Fetch API used effectively for data retrieval <br>✅ Async/await implemented properly<br>✅ Create (POST) functionality working as expected<br>✅ Read (GET) functionality displaying data correctly<br>✅ Delete functionality implemented successfully<br>✅ Form properly connected to API for creating items<br>✅ json-server used as the backend API<br><br>Just a couple small things to note:<br>⚠️ The update functionality is not implemented, but that's okay since it wasn't a core requirement. Consider adding it in the future for a full CRUD app!<br>💡 You might want to add some validation or sanitization of user input before sending it to the API, to prevent any potential issues.<br><br>Overall, fantastic work on the core functionality! You've demonstrated a solid grasp of using fetch and async/await to interact with an API. Well done! 💯<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">120/140 points</span>)  <br>✅ Repository is properly created and accessible<br>✅ File structure is logical and organized, with separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript<br>✅ Code is clean and well-formatted<br>⚠️ While your code is clear and readable, consider adding some comments, especially for complex or non-obvious parts. It will make it easier for others (and your future self!) to understand your code.<br>⚠️ The README file is missing. It's always a good practice to include a README that explains what your project does, how to set it up and run it, and any other relevant details.<br>✅ Commit history shows your development progress<br><br>Keep up the good work with your GitHub practices! Just remember to always include a helpful README and sprinkle in some comments where needed. 👍<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">70/70 points</span>)<br>🌟 No console errors observed during the app operation<br>✅ All the CRUD operations (except update) are working flawlessly<br>✅ Error handling implemented for failed API calls in the delete function<br>✅ Async/await used correctly without any errors<br>✅ The UI responds as expected to user interactions<br><br>Flawless execution! Your error handling and use of async/await are on point. Your app runs smoothly without any hiccups. Impressive work! 🔥<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">25/30 points</span>)<br>✅ Clear walkthrough of the app's functionality<br>✅ Demonstration of the successful CRUD operations<br>⚠️ Would have been nice to hear more about the specific challenges you faced with the API integration and how you overcame them. Sharing your learning process can be valuable for others.<br>✅ Code walkthrough highlighting the key components and how they work together<br><br>Your video explanation was clear and covered all the essential aspects of your project. In the future, consider sharing more about your development journey, challenges faced, and lessons learned. It adds a personal touch and insights that others can learn from. Keep up the great work! 🙌<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">355/400 points</span><br><br>You've done an outstanding job on this project, Nicholas! Your CRD app ticks almost all the boxes and demonstrates your proficiency with fetch, async/await, and API integration. The code is well-structured, the functionality is solid, and the UI is intuitive. <br><br>Some small areas for improvement: adding update functionality, more comments and a README in your GitHub repo, and sharing more about your learning journey in the video. But these are minor points and don't take away from the overall quality of your work.<br><br>Keep up the fantastic work and happy coding! 🚀💻✨ Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance.
