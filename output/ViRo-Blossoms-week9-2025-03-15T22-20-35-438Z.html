      <p>Thanks for sharing your code and video walkthrough! Here is my evaluation of your War card game implementation based on the provided instructions and rubric:</p><p>Completion (140/160 pts):
✅ Created a deck class with build and shuffle functions 
✅ Created a game class with players, score tracking, and game logic
✅ Game deals cards, determines round winners, and tracks overall score
⚠️ Some leftover commented out code related to a separate player class (-20 pts)</p><p>GitHub (140/140 pts):
✅ Code is saved in a public GitHub repository in a folder for this week's assignment
✅ Code is well-organized across multiple files</p><p>Errors/Functionality (70/70 pts): 
✅ Code runs without errors in the console
✅ Game deals cards, compares hands, determines round and overall winners correctly</p><p>Video (25/30 pts):
✅ 3-5 minute video explaining the code and demonstrating functionality
✅ Shows code running without errors 
✅ Discusses key components like classes, functions, and game logic
⚠️ A few spots where the explanation could be more detailed and polished (-5 pts)</p><p>Total Score: 375/400 = 94%</p><p>You've done a great job implementing the core components and game logic for this War card game simulation! The code is well-structured with classes for the deck and game.</p><p>I like how you found an effective shuffle algorithm and adapted it to work well for your needs. The main game loop handles the key steps of dealing cards, comparing hands, assigning points, and determining the overall winner clearly. </p><p>The video provides a solid overview of your code and shows it running successfully, with a few opportunities to expand on some of the explanations.</p><p>Some suggestions to consider:
<ul><li>Remove or clean up the leftover code and comments related to the player class you experimented with before switching approaches</li>
<li>When you have more time, adding unit tests would be a great way to further verify the game logic</li>
<li>Expanding the video walk-through with a more detailed discussion of certain aspects of the code could make it even stronger</li></ul></p><p>Overall, this is a successful implementation of the War card game that meets all the key assignment requirements. Well done! Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>
