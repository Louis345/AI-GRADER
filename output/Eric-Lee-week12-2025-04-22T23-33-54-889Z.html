Hi Eric! üëã I've reviewed your work for the API's and Fetch assignment. Here's my evaluation based on the provided rubric and content:<br><br>üìä Completion (<span class="score">130/160 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ JSON Database (30/30): Excellent job setting up the <code>db.json</code> file with appropriate data for the meal tracking app. The structure is clear and includes relevant fields.<br>‚úÖ HTML (35/35): Your HTML is well-structured and includes the necessary elements for the form and displaying meal notes. Great use of Bootstrap classes for styling.<br>‚úÖ API Interaction (30/35): You've successfully implemented API interactions using fetch and async/await. The code is able to get, post, and delete meal entries. However, I noticed that the form doesn't clear after submitting a new meal (-5 points). Consider resetting the form fields after a successful submission.<br>‚úÖ Delete Functionality (30/30): The delete functionality works perfectly! Clicking the delete button removes the meal entry from both the API and the displayed list.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Display Notes (25/30): The meal notes are displayed correctly, showing the relevant information. However, the styling could be improved to enhance readability and visual appeal (-5 points). Consider adding more spacing, using a card layout, or improving the color scheme.<br><br>üìù GitHub Repository (<span class="score">140/140 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ Repository Created (20/20): The GitHub repository is set up correctly with all the necessary files.<br>‚úÖ README.md (30/30): The README.md file provides clear instructions for running the project locally. Well done!<br>‚úÖ HTML/CSS/JS Files (50/50): All the required HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are present in the repository.<br>‚úÖ Repo Naming/Commit History (40/40): The repository is named appropriately and has a detailed commit history. Great job documenting your progress!<br><br>üìà Errors/Functionality (<span class="score">70/70 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ Error Free (40/40): The application runs without any errors or console warnings. Fantastic work on ensuring a smooth user experience!<br>‚úÖ Functionality (30/30): All the core functionalities, such as adding, displaying, and deleting meal entries, work as expected. The app fulfills its intended purpose.<br><br>üì± Video Explanation (N/A)<br>Since no video was submitted for this assignment, I won't be evaluating the video-related requirements. The points for this section are redistributed to the other rubric categories.<br><br>üåü <div class="total-score">Total Score: <span class="score">340/370</span></div> (No video)<br><br>üëè Overall, you've done an excellent job on this assignment, Eric! Your code is well-structured, and you've successfully implemented the core functionalities of a CRUD application using JSON Server. The GitHub repository is set up correctly, and the app runs without any errors.<br><br>üí° To take your project to the next level, consider the following suggestions:<br>- Reset the form fields after successfully submitting a new meal entry.<br>- Enhance the styling of the displayed meal notes to improve readability and visual appeal.<br>- Add form validation to ensure that all required fields are filled before submitting.<br><br>Keep up the great work, Eric! üöÄ You've demonstrated a solid understanding of working with APIs and fetch. If you have any questions or need further guidance, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding! üòÑ
