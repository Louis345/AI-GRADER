Hi Test! 👋 I've finished reviewing your Bootstrap project submission. Here's my detailed feedback:<br><br>📊 Completion (30 points)<br>I had some trouble accessing your GitHub repository files to assess full completion. ⚠️ It looks like you have an index.html file, which is a great start! But I couldn't see the actual HTML content or Bootstrap usage. Please double check that your repo is public and all files are committed. I'll have to hold off on assigning points for this section until I can see your code. 🔒 <br><br>📝 GitHub Repository (25 points)<br>Your GitHub repo is created, which is awesome! 🙌 I see a logical file structure with index.html, index.js, package.json and some test files. Assuming those files contain the required project code, you're in good shape here! I'm assigning <span class="score">20/25 points</span> for now. You can earn the remaining 5 points by pushing your full code. Keep it up! 💪<br><br>📈 Functionality (15 points)<br>I wasn't able to interact with your site to test functionality due to the repo access issue mentioned above. ⚠️ Once your code is available, I'll be looking for an error-free experience with working links, responsive layout, and solid Bootstrap implementation. Aim for clean, efficient code! I know you can do it. 🚀 Points TBD.<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (10 points)<br>I didn't find a YouTube video link or working closed captions in your submission. 🎥❓Creating a quick video to walk through your code is a helpful way to summarize your approach. Let me know if you have any questions about recording this - I'm happy to help! 😊 <br><br>➕ Total Score<br>Because of the missing video and repository content, I don't quite have enough to calculate a final grade yet. But don't worry, you're well on your way! Once you update your repo and add the walkthrough video, I'll be able to give you a complete score. 🎉<br><br>🙌 Overall, it looks like you're off to a solid start with your repo structure and project setup. I'm excited to see your finished Bootstrap site! Keep up the great work.<br><br>Here are a few suggestions as you wrap up:<br><br>💡 Make sure all your HTML, CSS and JS files are committed and pushed to GitHub. Double check your repo privacy settings too.<br><br>🛠️ As you finalize your code, aim for clean, well-formatted HTML with proper Bootstrap classes. Test your layout on various screen sizes for responsiveness.  <br><br>🔨 Don't forget to add some JavaScript functionality if needed! A couple interactive components can really enhance the user experience.<br><br>📹 Record a quick 2-3 minute walkthrough video highlighting your project's key features. Describe your code a bit too. It doesn't have to be super polished - just an overview is perfect!<br><br>You've got this, Test! 💪 Reach out if you have any other questions. I'm looking forward to seeing your final submission. Keep coding and stay awesome! 😎<br><br>Cheers,<br>Your Instructor
