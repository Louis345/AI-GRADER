    <p><strong>Week 17:</strong> Final Coding Project</p>
    <hr>
Hi Jerzey,<br><br>I've reviewed your final project submission. Here's my assessment based on the grading rubric for Week 17:<br><h2>Completion (<span class="score">160/320 points</span>)</h2>‚ö†Ô∏è The main issue I see is the lack of API integration, which is a core requirement for the final project. It appears your app is using only local state with useState to manage the todos. For a Week 17 project, you should be connecting to an external API or backend to persist the data.<br><br>Since there is no API integration, the maximum score I can give in this Completion section is <span class="score">160/320 points</span>. To get full points, you would need to implement full CRUD operations that connect to an API.<br><h2>GitHub (<span class="score">280/280 points</span>)</h2>‚úÖ Your GitHub repository is set up correctly, the project can be cloned and run without issues. The repository has a complete file structure and is well organized. Good work here.<br><h2>Errors (<span class="score">105/140 points</span>)</h2>‚úÖ From what I can see, the todo app works without any major errors in the functionality you've implemented. The local CRUD operations for adding, editing, and deleting todos are working.<br><br>‚ö†Ô∏è However, there are some missing error handling and edge cases that could be improved. For example, ensuring a title is required before allowing a todo to be added. <br><h2>Video (<span class="score">45/60 points</span>)</h2>‚úÖ Your video does a good job demonstrating the functionality of the todo app. It clearly shows the ability to add, edit and delete todos.<br><br>‚ö†Ô∏è To get full points, the video should also explain how the app is persisting data to an external source, which is not present here.<br><h2>Overall Feedback</h2>You've done a solid job building out the basic functionality of a todo app using React. Your code is structured well and uses appropriate React concepts like components and state management with useState. <br><br>The main area for improvement to meet the Week 17 requirements is integrating with an external API. This would allow your todos to persist even when the app is closed. It would also give you more practice with essential concepts like making HTTP requests and handling asynchronous data in React.<br><br>Consider building a simple backend API (e.g. using Node/Express) or using an existing public API to enhance your app. This would take it to the next level and align it with the goals for a final project.<br><br>Keep up the good work on your React skills! Let me know if you have any other questions.<br><br><strong>Total Score: 590 / 800</strong><br><br>Best regards,<br>Jamal Taylor
