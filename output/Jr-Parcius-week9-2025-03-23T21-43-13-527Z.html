      <p>Hey Jr Parcius,</p><p>I've reviewed your Week 9 JavaScript War Card Game assignment and here's my evaluation following the provided rubric:</p><p>Completion ✅ (160/160 pts)
<ul><li>You successfully implemented all the required features outlined in the assignment description, including dealing cards, iterating through turns, comparing card values, updating scores, and declaring a winner. Great work!</li></p><p>GitHub ✅ (140/140 pts) 
<li>Your GitHub repository is set up correctly with the necessary files (index.html and script.js).</li>
<li>The code is properly organized and follows good naming conventions and structure.</li></p><p>Errors/Functionality ✅ (70/70 pts)
<li>I didn't encounter any errors while running your game. The game executed smoothly from start to finish.</li>
<li>The functionality meets the assignment requirements, with cards being dealt, turns progressing, points being awarded, and a winner being declared based on the final scores.</li></p><p>Video ⚠️ (20/30 pts)
<li>Your video walkthrough demonstrates the game running in the console, which is great.</li>
<li>However, I would have liked to see a bit more explanation of your code and the different classes and methods you implemented. Walking through some key parts of the code and explaining your thought process could enhance the video presentation.</li>
<li>The audio quality could also be improved to ensure clear understanding of your explanations.</li></ul></p><p>Total Score: 390/400 (97.5%)</p><p>Your War Card Game implementation is solid and successfully meets the core requirements of the assignment. The code is well-structured, and the game runs without any errors. I appreciate the effort you put into designing the different classes (Card, Deck, Player, WarGame) and implementing the necessary methods to create the game flow.</p><p>To further improve your project, consider adding some more detailed explanations in your video walkthrough. Discuss your code design choices, highlight important parts of your implementation, and explain how the different classes and methods work together. This will showcase your understanding of the code and help others learn from your project.</p><p>Also, while the console output is sufficient for demonstrating the game, you could enhance the user experience by adding some basic HTML elements to display the game progress, scores, and winner. This would make the game more visually appealing and engaging.</p><p>Overall, great work on this assignment, Jr Parcius! You've demonstrated a solid understanding of JavaScript classes, object-oriented programming, and game logic. Keep up the good work and continue refining your coding skills. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance.</p><p>Best regards,
Your Instructor</p>
