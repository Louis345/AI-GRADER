      <p>Hi Amelia,</p><p>I've reviewed your JavaScript assignment submission and here is my evaluation based on the provided rubric:</p><p>Completion (30/30 points) ✅
You have successfully attempted all the required elements and submitted code for 30 points. Great job on covering each question thoroughly!</p><p>GitHub (20/25 points) ⚠️
Your GitHub repository is provided and the project files are able to be cloned and run. However, to receive full points, the code needs to be better structured for readability. Consider adding more comments to explain what has been attempted, and format the code with proper indentation.</p><p>Errors (8/10 points) ⚠️
The code runs as required with only minor errors for 8 points. There are a few small issues that need to be fixed to get it fully functional. For example, in the suggestShoes function, the "cloudy" condition is missing an "else" before the last curly brace.</p><p>Video Explanation (5/15 points) ⚠️
The video partially showcases the code requirements, but does not fully demonstrate the project's functionality. To improve, I'd suggest recording the video in a well-lit environment, speaking clearly and confidently, and walking through each part of the code while showing the corresponding output. Aim to showcase all the key aspects of your work.</p><p>Total Score: 63/80 (78.75%)</p><p>In summary, you've made a solid attempt at implementing the various JavaScript concepts covered in this assignment. Your strengths are in understanding how to work with arrays, loops, and functions. </p><p>To take your code to the next level, I recommend:
<ul><li>Cleaning up the formatting and adding comments for better readability </li>
<li>Thoroughly testing edge cases to handle any possible errors</li>
<li>Putting more time into planning and rehearsing your video to comprehensively explain your approach</li></ul></p><p>Keep up the hard work and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions! You're making great progress in building your JavaScript skills. With a bit more polish and attention to detail, I'm confident you'll excel in future assignments.</p><p>Best regards,
Your JavaScript Instructor</p>
