      <p>Hi Jesse,</p><p>Great work on your API's and Fetch assignment! I've reviewed your code and video, and here's my evaluation based on the grading rubric:</p><p>Completion (160 pts):
✅ Implemented a CRUD application (without update) using json-server or another API
✅ Used fetch and async/await to interact with the API
✅ Included forms to create/post entities
✅ Implemented deletion functionality
✅ Displayed fetched entities
Score: 160/160</p><p>GitHub (140 pts):
✅ GitHub repository contains the code used in the assignment
✅ Code is organized and well-structured
Score: 140/140</p><p>Errors/Functionality (70 pts):
✅ Application runs without any errors
✅ CRUD operations function as expected (creating, reading, deleting entities)
Score: 70/70</p><p>Video (30 pts):
✅ Video provides a clear explanation of the project
⚠️ Video could benefit from more detailed code walkthrough and explanations
Score: 25/30</p><p>Total Score: 395/400 (98.75%)</p><p>Jesse, you've done an excellent job on this assignment! Your code is well-organized, follows best practices, and demonstrates a solid understanding of working with APIs and fetch. The CRUD functionality is implemented correctly, allowing users to create, read, and delete items seamlessly.</p><p>I particularly liked how you broke down the code into separate functions for fetching items, creating items, and deleting items. This modular approach enhances code readability and maintainability. Additionally, your use of async/await and error handling ensures smooth execution of asynchronous operations.</p><p>One area where you could improve is in the video explanation. While you provided a good overview of the project, I would have liked to see a more detailed walkthrough of the code, explaining the key parts and how they work together. This would help showcase your understanding of the concepts even further.</p><p>Overall, fantastic work, Jesse! You've demonstrated a strong grasp of API integration and fetch in this assignment. Keep up the great work, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance.</p><p>Best regards,
Your Instructor</p>
