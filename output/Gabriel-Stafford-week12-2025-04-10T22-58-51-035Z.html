🌟 Hi Gabriel! I've reviewed your assignment and I'm excited to share my feedback with you. Let's dive in! 🚀<br><br>📊 Completion (160 points)<br>✅ Great job on completing the assignment requirements! Your CRUD application demonstrates the ability to create, read, and delete entities using fetch and async/await. The form for creating new games and the deletion functionality are implemented well. You've earned the full 160 points for completion! 💯<br><br>📝 GitHub Repository (140 points)<br>✅ Your GitHub repository is set up correctly with the necessary files. The code is organized and readable, making it easy to navigate. Keep up the excellent work with your version control practices! You've earned the full 140 points for the GitHub repository. 🙌<br><br>📈 Errors/Functionality (70 points)<br>⚠️ While your application is functional, there are a couple of areas that could be improved:<br>- Consider adding error handling for the fetch requests to provide a better user experience when there are network issues or API errors. 💡<br>- You mentioned not being sure how to generate IDs for new entries. One approach is to use a library like <code>uuid</code> to generate unique IDs on the client side before sending the data to the server. 🆔<br><br>Despite these minor areas for improvement, your application is working well overall. I'm awarding you 60 out of 70 points for the errors/functionality section. Keep up the good work! 👏<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (30 points)<br>✅ Your video explanation is clear and concise. You walked through the important parts of your code and provided insights into how the different functions work together. Great job on the video! You've earned the full 30 points. 🎥<br><br>🖥️ <div class="total-score">Total Score: <span class="score">390/400</span></div><br>Fantastic work, Gabriel!
