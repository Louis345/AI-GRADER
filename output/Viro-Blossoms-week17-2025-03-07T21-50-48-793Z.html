290/320 points</p><p>GitHub (280 points):  
✅ The GitHub repository contains the full project code across multiple files. The code is organized into components and follows a reasonable structure.
280/280 points</p><p>Errors/Functionality (140 points):
⚠️ The core functionality works, but a few errors were encountered in the video, such as with the delete function. The presenter notes the code needs some cleanup and expansion. 
120/140 points</p><p>Video (60 points):
✅ The video clearly demonstrates the project's functionality by walking through the user flow. The presenter explains the key components despite not feeling well. The video meets the core requirements.
60/60 points</p><p>Total Score: 750/800 (93.75%)</p><p>You've done an excellent job putting together a functional full-stack application that implements the core CRUD actions. The code is structured well and the video provides a helpful overview.</p><p>Some suggestions for improvement:
<ul><li>Fix the errors encountered, especially with the delete function</li>
<li>Expand the create and update forms to accept more ice cream attributes</li>
<li>Polish the visual styling to make the UI cleaner and more appealing  </li>
<li>Provide code comments explaining key sections and logic</li></ul></p><p>Overall this is impressive work, especially considering you built it while sick. With some debugging and enhancements, you'll have a top-notch application. Well done demonstrating your full-stack development skills!</p><p>Let me know if you have any other questions. I'm happy discuss specifics of your code in more detail. Feel better soon!</p>
