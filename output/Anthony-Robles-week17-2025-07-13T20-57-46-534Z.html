    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of the final coding project based on the provided rubric and content:<br><br>📊 Completion (<span class="score">220/320 points</span>)<br>✅ The project appears to have implemented most of the required functionality based on the video explanation<br>✅ A React application was created that connects to an API (Mock API) <br>✅ CRUD operations for creating, reading, updating and deleting items are described<br>⚠️ Without access to the actual code repository, I cannot fully confirm if all requirements were completely met<br>💡 In the future, ensure the GitHub repository is publicly accessible for complete evaluation<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">80/280 points</span>)  <br>⚠️ The GitHub repository URL was provided but access failed with an unknown error<br>⚠️ Without being able to clone or view the repository, the code structure and organization cannot be evaluated<br>🛠️ Double check the repository settings to ensure it is public and the URL is correct<br>🔨 If the repository is private, consider adding the instructor as a collaborator for grading purposes<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">70/140 points</span>)<br>✅ Based on the video demonstration, the core functionality seems to work without major errors<br>✅ Items can be created, edited, and deleted through the UI<br>⚠️ Some challenges were mentioned around modal form reset and data population, but it's unclear if these were fully resolved<br>💡 More detailed explanations of how the challenges were overcome would help in evaluating this area<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">60/60 points</span>)<br>✅ The provided video transcript showcases all the key parts of the project<br>👏 The explanation covers the major functionality, tech stack, and connected API<br>🌟 The different React components and pages are described well<br>💯 Challenges faced during development are discussed, giving good insight into the process<br>🔥 The video demonstrates the CRUD features in action <br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">430/800 points</span><br><br>Overall, this project shows a good understanding of building a React application with TypeScript, connecting it to an API, and implementing CRUD operations. The video explanation is thorough and covers all the important aspects. <br><br>The main limitations in providing a complete evaluation are the inaccessible GitHub repository and relying solely on the video transcript without seeing the actual code. With the provided content, I've aimed to give credit where possible while noting the areas I couldn't fully assess.<br><br>To improve the project, focus on:<br>- 🔒 Ensuring the GitHub repository is publicly accessible or providing access for grading <br>- 📝 Commenting the code well to explain key parts of the implementation<br>- ✅ Resolving any lingering issues with form resets and data population<br>- 💪 Expanding the tests to cover more edge cases and potential errors<br><br>Keep up the solid work on building full-stack applications! Let me know if you have any other questions.
