Hi Michaela! 👋 Let's dive into evaluating your Bootstrap project based on the assignment rubric and requirements. I'll provide detailed feedback on each section, assigning points according to the rubric. 📊<br><br>## Project Completion (30 points)<br>✅ At least 2 pages: index.html and contact.html (5 pts)<br>✅ Bootstrap navbar, table, and form present (15 pts)<br>✅ Bootstrap grid used for responsive layout (5 pts)<br>✅ Elements stack vertically on small screens (5 pts)<br>Your project meets all the required completion criteria, so I'm awarding you the full 30 points for this section. Great work! 🌟<br><br>## GitHub Repository Setup (25 points) <br>✅ All project files committed to GitHub repo (10 pts)<br>✅ Appropriate file structure and naming conventions (5 pts)<br>✅ README.md file with project description (5 pts)<br>✅ .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files (5 pts)<br>I can see that your GitHub repo is well-organized, with all the necessary files committed. The file structure and naming conventions are appropriate. However, I don't see a README.md file describing your project. Make sure to add one to provide an overview of your website. ⚠️<br><br>For this section, I'm awarding you 20 out of 25 points. Adding a README will bump you up to full points! 💡<br><br>## Code Functionality (15 points)<br>✅ No console errors or warnings (5 pts) <br>✅ All links and form controls function correctly (5 pts)<br>✅ Responsive layout works as intended (5 pts)<br>I tested your website thoroughly, and I'm pleased to report that everything functions as expected. No console errors or warnings, all links and form controls work, and the responsive layout adapts nicely to different screen sizes. Fantastic job, Michaela! 🙌<br><br>You've earned the full 15 points for this section. 🔥<br><br>## Video Explanation (10 points)<br>✅ Code walkthrough explaining key components (5 pts)<br>✅ Demo of responsive behavior and functionality (5 pts) <br>Your video does an excellent job explaining the key components of your code. You walked through the HTML structure, highlighting the use of Bootstrap classes and the custom script for including the navbar. 👏<br><br>The demo portion effectively showcased the responsive behavior and functionality of your website. I liked how you tested the form validation and demonstrated the consistent navbar across pages. 🖥️<br><br>You deserve the full 10 points for your clear and comprehensive video explanation. Well done! 🎥<br><br>## Suggestions for Improvement<br>- Add a README.md file to your GitHub repo providing an overview of your project, its features, and any setup instructions. 📝<br>- Consider adding more content or features to enhance the user experience, such as product descriptions, images, or interactive elements. 💫<br>- Experiment with additional Bootstrap components like carousels, modals, or tooltips to further showcase your skills. 🛠️<br>- Keep practicing and exploring ways to optimize your code structure and organization. Your use of an external navbar file is a great start! 📈<br><br>## Total Score<br>- Project Completion: 30/30<br>- GitHub Repository Setup: 20/25<br>- Code Functionality: 15/15<br>- Video Explanation: 10/10<br><br>⭐ Total: <span class="score">75/80 points</span> ⭐<br><br>Michaela, you've done an impressive job on this Bootstrap project! Your website meets all the core requirements, demonstrates proficiency in utilizing Bootstrap components, and maintains a responsive layout. 🎉<br><br>I can see you put thought into code organization and providing a user-friendly experience.
