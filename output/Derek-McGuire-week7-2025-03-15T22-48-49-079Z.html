✅ Your video walkthrough covers the key aspects of the assignment. You showcase the console output demonstrating that your code runs correctly. 
⚠️ Consider elaborating a bit more on your approach and thought process for some of the more complex prompts. This can help reinforce your understanding.
✅ Your presentation is clear and easy to follow. Nice work on the video!</p><p>Total Score: 70/70 (100%)</p><p>You did an outstanding job on this assignment, Derek! Your code is clean, well-structured, and properly implements all the required features. I'm impressed with your solutions, especially your creative take on Prompt 13 with the "emordnilap" function. </p><p>To take your understanding even further, I'd encourage you to:
<ul><li>Experiment with additional string and array methods to streamline some of your solutions</li>
<li>Add code comments explaining your thought process on the more complex prompts</li>
<li>Consider edge cases and how you could handle them (e.g. empty arrays, invalid inputs)</li></ul></p><p>Keep up the fantastic work! You have a solid grasp of the core JavaScript concepts covered this week. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. I'm confident you'll continue to excel as we dive deeper into JavaScript. Keep coding and challenging yourself!</p>
