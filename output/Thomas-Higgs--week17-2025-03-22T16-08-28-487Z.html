    <div id="content-to-copy">
      <p>Here is my evaluation of your final coding project:</p><p>Completion (20/20 pts):
✅ All required elements are present - Home page, Page 2, Page 3
✅ Proper use of React components and routing</p><p>GitHub (40/40 pts):
✅ Code is properly organized in a GitHub repository
✅ Repo contains all necessary files and folders
✅ Code is well commented</p><p>Errors/Functionality (32/40 pts):
✅ Application runs without errors
⚠️ Some functionality is not fully implemented (-8 pts)
  - Accordions on pages 2 and 3 do not have content
  - Form submission on home page does not update list</p><p>Video (52/60 pts):
✅ Video provides a thorough demonstration of the application 
⚠️ Some key features could have been explained in more detail (-4 pts)
✅ Presenter spoke clearly and explained their process well
⚠️ Video quality and editing could be improved slightly (-4 pts)</p><p>Total Score: 144/160 pts (90%)</p><p>Summary:
You've done an excellent job on this final project! I'm impressed with the creativity you brought in expanding beyond a basic to-do app. The fantasy theme is engaging and your UI design with the changing background is a nice touch. </p><p>The core functionality is mostly working, but there are a few gaps to address, mainly with the accordions and form submission. Make sure all the features you include are fully built out.</p><p>Your code is well structured and organized, and you demonstrated a solid grasp of React fundamentals. With a bit more polish on the functionality and video presentation, this would be a top-notch project.</p><p>For future improvements, I'd suggest:
<ul><li>Finish implementing the features you started, like accordion content </li>
<li>Have the form submission update your list</li>
<li>Provide more detail in your video on how each part works</li>
<li>Refine the video production quality</li></ul></p><p>Overall though, fantastic work! You put a lot of effort into this and it shows. Keep up the great work and creativity. Let me know if you have any other questions!</p>
