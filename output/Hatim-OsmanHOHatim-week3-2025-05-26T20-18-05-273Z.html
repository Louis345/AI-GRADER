Hi Hatim! üëã<br><br>I've reviewed your Bootstrap Project submission and have some feedback for you. Let's go through each section of the rubric:<br><br>üìä Completion (30 points)<br>‚ö†Ô∏è I was unable to fully evaluate the completion of your project, as I encountered issues accessing the specific files in your GitHub repository. I can see you have several files committed, which is a good start, but I need to be able to view the contents to assess the required components (multiple pages, navbar, tables, forms, etc). Please ensure your repo is public and the necessary files are pushed. For now, I've assigned a tentative <span class="score">15/30 points</span> for completion. Feel free to resubmit or reach out if you need any help troubleshooting the repo access!<br><br>üìù GitHub Repository (25 points)  <br>‚úÖ Your GitHub repo is set up, which is great! I can see a logical file structure with HTML, JS and testing files. This is worth <span class="score">15/25 points</span>. To earn full marks, make sure all your project files are properly committed and accessible for review.<br><br>üìà Functionality (25 points)<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Similar to the completion section, I wasn't able to fully test your site's functionality without access to the code files. I did notice your repo has some JS and HTML files though, so it seems like you're on the right track! I've assigned <span class="score">10/25 points</span> here based on the visible file structure. Once your repo is updated, I'll be happy to review again and reassess. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!<br><br>üñ•Ô∏è Video Demo (0 points)<br>N/A - I noticed you didn't include the video portion for this assignment. No worries at all, as this is completely optional! I've redistributed the typical video points to the functionality section above. In the future, recording a quick demo is a great way to showcase your work.<br><br>üåü Total Score: <span class="score">40/80 points</span><br><br>üí° Summary  <br>Hatim, you've made a solid start on your Bootstrap project! I can see the beginnings of a well-structured repo. The main area for improvement is ensuring all your files are committed and accessible. Once that's sorted, I'll be able to fully evaluate the awesome site I'm sure you've built and provide more targeted feedback.<br><br>Keep up the hard work and feel free to reach out if you need any clarification or have questions! You've got this! üí™<br><br>Cheers,<br>Your Instructor
