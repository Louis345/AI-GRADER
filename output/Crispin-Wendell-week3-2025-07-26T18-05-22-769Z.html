Hey Crispin, <br><br>I've finished reviewing your Bootstrap project submission. Here's my detailed feedback for each section:<br><br>📊 Completion (<span class="score">0/30 points</span>)<br>Unfortunately I was unable to evaluate the completion of your Bootstrap project, as there was an error accessing your GitHub repository. ⚠️ Without being able to review your code and the implemented features, I cannot assign points for this section at this time. Please double check your repository settings and resubmit so I can take a look! 🛠️<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">5/25 points</span>)  <br>While I couldn't access your repository to evaluate the organization and commit history, I'm awarding 5 points since you did submit a link, indicating you likely created a repo as required. However, there seems to be an access issue that needs to be resolved before I can give full credit. 💡 Make sure your repo is public and the link is correct! Feel free to resubmit and I'll happily re-evaluate. 👍<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">0/15 points</span>)<br>Since I couldn't access your repository files, I'm unable to check for any console errors, broken links, or invalid HTML/CSS at this time. ⚠️ Proper functionality is a key part of the assignment, so once you resolve the repo access, I'll be checking this area closely! 🔍 <br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">0/10 points</span>)<br>I noticed you didn't include the required video walkthrough explaining your project. 🎥 This is an important part of the submission where you get to showcase your work! In the future, be sure to record a short video discussing your design choices, demonstrating the features, and reflecting on any challenges. It's great practice! 👌<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">5/70 points</span><br><br>So in summary, while I couldn't fully grade your project this time due to the repository access issue and missing video, I see evidence that you made an attempt at the assignment which is a solid start! 💪 <br><br>My advice would be to double-check your GitHub repo link and settings, record the explainer video, and resubmit so I can give you proper feedback on all the great Bootstrap work I'm sure you did! You've got this! 🚀<br><br>If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out. I'm here to help you succeed! 👍<br><br>Keep up the effort! 🌟<br>Prof. Wendell
