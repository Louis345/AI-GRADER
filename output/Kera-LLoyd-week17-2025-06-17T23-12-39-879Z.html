    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of the assignment based on the rubric:<br><br>üìä Completion (<span class="score">220/320 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ React application created with API connection<br>‚úÖ 10 custom components included (Header, Footer, Navbar, Card, Form, List, etc.) <br>‚ö†Ô∏è Only some CRUD operations working - delete functions but edit and favorites do not<br>‚ö†Ô∏è 3 page requirement met but contact form not fully implemented<br><br>The core of the React app is in place with API integration. Great work including many custom components! However, the CRUD functionality is not 100% there, with some key features like edit and favorites missing. The contact form also needs to be hooked up. Keep working on ironing out those final pieces to meet all the requirements.<br><br>üìù GitHub (<span class="score">280/280 points</span>)  <br>‚úÖ GitHub URL provided and repository is accessible<br>‚úÖ Project can be successfully cloned and run<br>‚úÖ Complete file structure present<br>‚úÖ Repository is well-organized<br><br>Fantastic job with your GitHub repository! The URL works, the project can be cloned and run without issues, and all the expected files are present. The repo is clearly structured and easy to navigate. Full points here!<br><br>üìà Errors (<span class="score">70/140 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ App loads without major errors<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Some functionality not working as required (edit, favorites)<br>‚ö†Ô∏è A few minor bugs/console errors present<br>üí° Focus on cleaning up the remaining bugs and getting all features fully operational<br><br>The core app runs, which is great! However, we need to squash those lingering bugs and get edit, favorites, etc. across the finish line for full functionality. Comb through the code to identify and fix the issues. You're on the right track, just need to polish it up.<br><br>üì± Video Explanation (<span class="score">30/60 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ 4-minute video clearly demonstrating the project<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Some key features not shown (because not fully implemented)<br>üí° In future, make sure to showcase all the project requirements in the video<br><br>The video walkthrough was clear and concise. Good job explaining the components and showing the app in action. However, since some functionality was not complete (edit, favorites), you couldn't demo those pieces. Aim to have all features finished before recording the video so you can show everything off.<br><br>üåü Total Score: <span class="score">600/800 points</span><br><br>Overall, this is a strong start on the final project! The React foundation is solid, the GitHub repo is in great shape, and you've put together an extensive collection of components. The main areas to focus on are getting all the CRUD operations working, fixing the remaining bugs, and polishing up the UI/UX. <br><br>With some targeted improvements in those areas, you'll be able to take this project to the next level. Let me know if you have any other questions - keep up the great work! üí™üëç
