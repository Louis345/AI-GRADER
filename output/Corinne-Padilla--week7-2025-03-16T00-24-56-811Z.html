      <p>Hello Corinne! Thank you for sharing your Week 7 Coding Project walkthrough. I appreciate you taking the time to record this video and explain your approach. Here is my evaluation of your assignment based on the provided rubric:</p><p>Completion:
✅ All requirements have been attempted and 30/30 points are awarded. You went through the instructions thoroughly and completed each section of the coding assignment.</p><p>GitHub:
✅ The GitHub repository was provided with the required files and folder structure. The code is able to run, so 25/25 points.</p><p>Errors:
✅ The code works as required with no errors. You debugged issues like an infinite loop caused by a syntax error. All requirements are met correctly, so 10/10 points.</p><p>Video Explanation:
✅ The video showcases all requirements and does an excellent job explaining the project. You walked through each part of the code, demonstrating the output and discussing how you resolved errors encountered. The video provides helpful insight into your coding process. 5/5 points awarded.</p><p>Additional Feedback:
I like how you took the initiative to transcribe the instructions from the video first before starting the assignment. That preparation allowed you to work through most of it independently, only referencing the walkthrough for parts you were unsure about. </p><p>Debugging the infinite loop issue caused by a misplaced comma showed great problem-solving skills. Those small syntax errors can definitely cause frustrating bugs sometimes! But you calmly figured out the cause and corrected it.</p><p>The personalized background gradient is a nice touch to make the page visually appealing to you as you code. Tailoring your environment can make the development process more enjoyable.</p><p>Your video had a comfortable, conversational tone as you explained your work. The pacing made it easy to follow along with your thought process. Keep up those wonderful communication skills!</p><p>Total Score: 70/70 Points (100%)</p><p>You did a fantastic job on this coding assignment, Corinne! The functionality is all there, the code runs smoothly, and your video walkthrough gave helpful insights. Keep up the excellent work as you continue growing your programming skills. Let me know if you have any other questions!</p>
