    <p><strong>Week 9:</strong> JavaScript Unit Final Coding Project - WAR Card Game</p>
    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of the WAR card game assignment submitted by Adam Peters:<br><br>üìä Completion (<span class="score">0/160 points</span>)<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Unfortunately I was unable to evaluate the completion criteria since the GitHub repository content could not be accessed. The repository seems to exist but returned a 404 error, indicating the files may not be properly committed or the repository may be set to private. Without being able to review the code, I cannot determine if the game was implemented correctly using OOP concepts, if it deals cards properly, iterates through rounds, tracks points accurately, and declares a winner. Please ensure your repository is public and all code files are committed so I can fully evaluate your project. Feel free to resubmit and I'll be happy to take another look! üí™<br><br>üìù GitHub (<span class="score">30/140 points</span>)  <br>‚úÖ Great job creating a GitHub repository for this project! Having all your code stored in a central location using version control is an important best practice.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è However, I had to deduct some points because I encountered a 404 error when trying to access the repository content. This could mean the files weren't properly pushed or the repository may be set to private. Double check your repository settings and make sure all your code files are committed and accessible.<br>üí° For full credit, be sure to include a .gitignore file that excludes the node_modules directory. Add clear comments to your code explaining its functionality. Use meaningful names for variables and functions to enhance code readability.<br><br>üìà Errors (<span class="score">0/70 points</span>)<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Since I was unable to access and run the code, I could not evaluate if the game runs without any crashes or errors. Ensuring an error-free execution is critical to provide a smooth user experience.<br>üí° When you resubmit, I'll check that all 26 rounds play correctly, cards are dealt properly, points are tracked accurately, and there are no logical errors in the game flow. Aim for a fully functional game without any hiccups! üéÆ<br><br>üì± Video Explanation (<span class="score">0/30 points</span>)<br>‚ÑπÔ∏è I noticed that no video explanation was submitted with this assignment. That's okay! I've adjusted the total points possible to 370 instead of 400. In the future, consider including a short video walkthrough of your code. It's a great way to showcase your understanding and highlight the key functionality you implemented. <br><br>üåü Total Score: <span class="score">30/370 points</span><br><br>Thanks for submitting your WAR card game project, Adam! I know you put a lot of effort into this assignment. While I couldn't fully grade it this time due to the repository access issue, I'm confident you're on the right track. üöÄ <br><br>Here are my suggestions for improvement:<br>1. Double check that your GitHub repository is public and all your code files are properly pushed. This will allow me to access your work and provide a complete evaluation.<br>2. Add comments to your code explaining the functionality of different sections. This enhances readability and makes it easier to understand your logic.<br>3. Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules so those packages aren't tracked in version control.  <br>4. Ensure your game runs without any errors or crashes. Test it thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs.<br>5. If you have time, record a short video explaining your code and demonstrating the game. It's a great way to showcase your understanding!<br><br>Feel free to resubmit your assignment and I'll be happy to take another look. Keep up the great work, and let me know if you have any questions! üëç
