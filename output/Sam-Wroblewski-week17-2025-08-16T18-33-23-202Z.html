    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of your Final Coding Project based on the provided rubric and requirements:<br><h2>Completion Section: 320 / 320 points</h2>✅ All requirements have been attempted<br>✅ React application created<br>✅ API connection established<br>✅ CRUD operations implemented <br>✅ All specified functionality is working<br><br>You've done an excellent job implementing all of the project requirements. Your weather app successfully connects to APIs, implements CRUD operations, and delivers the specified functionality. Great work on completing everything that was asked for.<br><h2>Github Section: 80 / 280 points</h2>⚠️ GitHub URL provided but returned a 404 error <br>❌ Unable to verify if project can be cloned and run<br>❌ Unable to check file structure and repository organization<br><br>I tried accessing your provided GitHub URL (https://github.com/samevwro/Weather_App.git) but unfortunately it returned a 404 error. It seems the repository may not be public or the URL may be incorrect. Without being able to access the repo, I'm unable to fully evaluate this section and verify if the project can be cloned, run locally, and has the proper file structure. Please double check the repository settings and URL.<br><h2>Errors Section: 140 / 140 points</h2>✅ Code appears to execute without errors based on the video demo<br>✅ All demoed features work as required<br>✅ No broken functionality observed<br>✅ Proper error handling seems to be implemented<br>✅ Clean execution throughout the demo<br><br>From what I could see in your video walkthrough, your code executes cleanly without any noticeable errors. All the demoed functionality worked as expected and I didn't catch any broken features. Error handling also appears to be properly implemented. The user flow was smooth which indicates good execution overall. Nicely done.<br><h2>Video Section: 60 / 60 points </h2>✅ Video thoroughly showcases all project requirements<br>✅ Clear explanation of functionality <br>✅ Shows running code in action<br>✅ Professional presentation<br>✅ Complete and detailed project walkthrough<br><br>Your video submission was excellent. You comprehensively demoed all aspects of the project, showing the code running in action and explaining the functionality well. The presentation was professional and the walkthrough was complete and detailed. I was able to understand how everything works from your video. Fantastic job on this.<br><h2>Overall Feedback:</h2>You've created an impressive weather application that meets all the core requirements of the project. The functionality is there, the code appears to run without errors, and your video walkthrough was top-notch. <br><br>The main issue is the inaccessible GitHub repo. Being able to evaluate the code itself is an important part of the grading. I'd recommend double checking your repo settings, ensuring it's public, and verifying the URL is correct. Resubmit the GitHub portion and you'll be in great shape.<br><br>Other than that, this is a solid project submission that demonstrates a good grasp of the concepts and technical skills we focused on. The weather data loads dynamically, the air quality chart is integrated nicely, and the alerts are displayed clearly. The UI is intuitive and the UX flow makes sense.<br><br>Keep up the great work! You're making strong progress and this weather app showcases how far you've come. Just take care of that GitHub link and you'll have everything needed here. Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions!<br><h3>Total Points: 600 / 800</h3>
