📊 Completion (<span class="score">140/160 points</span>)<br>✅ Fetch API used for data retrieval<br>✅ Async/await implemented properly <br>✅ Create (POST) functionality working<br>✅ Read (GET) functionality displaying data<br>⚠️ Delete functionality not fully implemented (-10 points)<br>✅ Forms properly connected to API<br>✅ json-server used as API<br><br>Overall, your CRUD application is mostly complete and functional! You did a great job integrating the Fetch API and using async/await to handle the asynchronous operations. The Create and Read functionality are working well. 💪<br><br>The one area that needs a bit more work is the Delete feature. Based on your video, it seems you are still working on fixing a bug related to deleting books. Keep at it - I'm confident you'll solve that issue! 🛠️<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">100/140 points</span>)  <br>✅ Repository properly created and accessible <br>⚠️ File structure is okay but could be more organized (-10 points)<br>⚠️ Code comments are minimal - adding more would improve readability (-20 points)<br>⚠️ README file is very basic - consider expanding it (-10 points)<br>✅ Commit history shows development progress<br><br>Your GitHub repository is set up correctly and accessible. Your commit history demonstrates your development process, which is great! 👏<br><br>A few suggestions to level up your GitHub game:<br>- Organize your files into folders (e.g. /src, /public, etc) 📂<br>- Add more detailed code comments explaining key functionality 💡<br>- Flesh out your README with project overview, setup instructions, etc 📝<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">60/70 points</span>)<br>✅ No major console errors during demo<br>⚠️ Delete operation not working (-10 points) <br>✅ Create and Read operations work correctly<br>✅ Proper async/await usage without errors<br>✅ UI responds correctly to interactions<br><br>Your error handling is pretty solid overall. The main functionality works without any console errors, and your use of async/await is on point! 🎯<br><br>The only hiccup is the delete functionality, which you mentioned is a known bug you're working on. No worries - debugging is all part of the development process. You've got this! 💪<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">25/30 points</span>)<br>✅ Clear explanation of project functionality <br>⚠️ More detailed code walkthrough would be helpful (-5 points)<br>✅ Demonstration of most CRUD operations<br>✅ Brief mention of integration challenges (delete bug)<br><br>Your video does a nice job summarizing the project functionality and demoing the working CRUD operations. I appreciate you mentioning the challenges you faced with the delete feature. 😊<br><br>To improve future videos, consider doing a more detailed code walkthrough highlighting key parts of your JavaScript. This will reinforce your understanding and help others learning from your project. 📽️<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">325/400 points</span><br><br>You delivered a functional CRUD application that meets most of the requirements! Your code showcases a solid understanding of working with APIs, async/await, and DOM manipulation. 👏<br><br>Some areas to focus on:<br>- Squashing that delete bug 🐛<br>- Improving code organization and comments 🗂️ <br>- Expanding your README 📝<br>- Diving deeper in video explanations 🎥<br><br>Keep up the great work, Griselda! You're making excellent progress. Let me know if you have any other questions! 😄
