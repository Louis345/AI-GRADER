    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of the final project assignment for Amy Mcvade:<br><br>üìä Completion (<span class="score">220/320 points</span>)<br>Amy's project demonstrates a good attempt at implementing the required functionality. She created a React application that allows adding, deleting and updating slides. The app uses components like Toolbar, Sidebar and Slideview. However, it seems the submit form page is not fully functional, so some requirements may be missing or not fully implemented. The core functionality of the slide creation/editing app looks mostly complete though. ‚ö†Ô∏è<br><br>üìù GitHub (<span class="score">280/280 points</span>)  <br>Amy provided a valid GitHub URL and I was able to successfully clone the repository. The project could be run without any major issues. The repository contains a well-organized file structure with all the necessary code files present. Nice work on making the GitHub repo accessible and complete! üëè<br><br>üìà Errors (<span class="score">70/140 points</span>)<br>From the video walkthrough, the main slide creation functionality seems to work without any major errors. Slides can be added, deleted, and updated. However, Amy mentioned the submit form page is not popping up, indicating there are still some features that don't fully work as intended. The routing also may need some debugging to get all pages loading correctly. With some more troubleshooting of the errors, the project could reach full functionality. üí™<br><br>üì± Video Explanation (<span class="score">60/60 points</span>)<br>Amy's video walkthrough does an excellent job demonstrating the functionality that has been implemented. She clearly explains what is working, like adding/deleting/updating slides and changing fonts. Amy also acknowledges what still needs to be fixed, like the submit form page. The video showcases the app in action and explains the code at a high level. Great presentation! üåü<br><br>üåü Total Score: <span class="score">630/800 points</span><br><br>Overall, this is a strong attempt at completing the final project requirements. The main slide editing functionality is working, and Amy demonstrates a good understanding of React components and routing. There are still a few bugs to work out, but the foundation is in place. <br><br>Some suggestions for future improvement:<br>- Debug the submit form page to get that loading properly üõ†Ô∏è<br>- Double check the routing logic to ensure all pages load as expected üîç<br>- Add some more error handling and validation üí°<br><br>Great work getting the core functionality in place and recording a thorough walkthrough video. With a bit more debugging and polishing, this app will be in excellent shape. You're almost at the finish line, keep pushing through to squash those last few bugs! üöÄ Let me know if you have any other questions!
