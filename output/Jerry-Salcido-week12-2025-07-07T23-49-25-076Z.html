Hey Jerry! 👋 Thanks for submitting your CRUD application with API integration. Let's take a look at how you did! 🔍<br><br>📊 Completion (<span class="score">80/160 points</span>)<br>✅ Great job setting up the API URL and fetching student data! The display of students with their name and assignment looks good.<br>⚠️ However, it seems the create (POST) functionality is not working properly due to some server compatibility issues. This is a key requirement so a significant amount of points were deducted.<br>✅ The delete functionality appears to be working as intended - nice work!<br>⚠️ I didn't see clear evidence of the update (PUT) operation working from the video. Please make sure to demo this next time.<br>💡 For full points, all CRUD operations should be functional with the API. Keep working on ironing out those server issues!<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">70/140 points</span>)  <br>⚠️ The provided GitHub repository link gives a 404 error, so I wasn't able to access your code. Make sure the repo is public!<br>❌ Without access to the repo, I couldn't evaluate the file structure, code quality, README, or commit history.<br>🛠️ Double check your repo link and permissions. Committing code to GitHub is essential for collaboration and evaluation.<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">40/70 points</span>)<br>⚠️ There were some terminal errors related to the JSON server and updating the database. The POST operation failed due to this.<br>✅ However, the GET and DELETE operations seemed to work without errors from what I could see.<br>💡 Solving the server issues should help get rid of those pesky errors. Don't hesitate to ask for help if you get stuck!<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">25/30 points</span>)<br>✅ Your video walkthrough showed the key parts of the application, including the form for adding students and the list display. <br>⚠️ The audio was a bit choppy at times but I could mostly follow along. Just aim to speak slowly and clearly.<br>💡 For full points, make sure to show all CRUD operations working if possible. Explaining your code is also helpful!<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">215/400 points</span><br><br>Overall, this is a good start Jerry! 🙌 The main things to work on are:<br>1. Resolving the server issues to get all CRUD operations working <br>2. Making sure your GitHub repo is accessible <br>3. Demonstrating a fully functional app in your video<br><br>Keep up the coding practice and don't get discouraged by bugs! 💪 You're making great progress. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!<br><br>Let me know if you update your repo or video and I'll be happy to review again. Keep up the awesome work! 👏
