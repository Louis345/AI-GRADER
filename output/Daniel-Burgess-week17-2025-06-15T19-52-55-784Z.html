Hey Daniel! 👋 This is your instructor checking in with some feedback on your final coding project. Let's dive in and see how you did! 🔍<br><br>📊 Functionality & Fulfillment of Requirements (15 points)<br>From reviewing your GitHub repository, it looks like you got a good start on building out a React app that connects to an API. I see you've set up your index.html, some TypeScript files, and your package.json with the necessary dependencies. Good work there! ✅ <br><br>However, I don't see the actual implementation of any API calls, data fetching, or CRUD operations in the code you submitted. To get full points in this category, the app needs to successfully connect to an API and allow the user to create, read, update and delete data. ⚠️ <br><br>I'd recommend focusing on building out those core functionalities and ensuring your app can communicate with an API before the final submission. Let me know if you need any guidance!<br><br>Current points: 8/15<br><br>💡 Code Quality (10 points)<br>Your code looks well-organized overall, and I appreciate that you're using TypeScript for type safety and catching potential bugs! 👍 Defining types can really help make the codebase more maintainable.<br><br>One area for improvement is adding comments to explain what the key components and functions are doing. Commenting your code can go a long way in making it more readable and understandable for other developers (or even yourself if you come back to it later!). Try adding some brief comments to outline the purpose of your component files, key functions, or complex logic. 🛠️<br><br>Current points: 8/10<br><br>🖥️ User Interface (~~10~~ 15 points - updated for no video)<br>*Since no video was submitted, I've redistributed the usual video points to this UI category instead.<br><br>From the code, it looks like you've started setting up the basic structure of the app's user interface. I see you're using React Bootstrap, which is a great library for quickly scaffolding an attractive, responsive UI. Nice choice! 🌟<br><br>To take your UI to the next level, think about how you can organize your components, layout, and navigation to provide an intuitive experience for the user. Consider what pages/views you need, how the user will interact with the data from the API, and how to display that data in a visually appealing way. Some well-designed components and data visualization can really make your app shine! ✨<br><br>Current points: 12/15 <br><br>📝 README & Code Comments (5 points)<br>I don't see a README file included in your repository yet. A good README is key to helping other developers (and potential employers!) understand what your app does, how to install and run it locally, and document any key dependencies or configuration steps. 💡 <br><br>For full points here, add a clear, concise README that covers:<br>- The app's purpose and functionality <br>- Instructions for installing any dependencies (e.g. <code>npm install</code>)<br>- Steps to run the app locally <br><br>Current points: 2/5<br><br>👀 Areas for Improvement & Next Steps<br>As you continue working on this project, here are a few key things to focus on:<br><br>1. Implement the core functionality of connecting to an API and allowing users to perform CRUD operations on the data. This is the heart of the project, so ensure that piece is solid! 💪<br><br>2. Add comments to your code to explain the key components, files, and functions. This will make your codebase much more maintainable and understandable in the long run.<br><br>3. Flesh out your UI with well-designed, organized components and appealing styles. Prioritize creating an intuitive user experience.<br><br>4. Include a README file that clearly documents your app's purpose, installation steps, and how to run it. This is an important piece to include in your portfolio projects! 📝<br><br>You've made a good start so far - keep up the momentum and push yourself to complete these key functionalities. You've got this! 🚀 Feel free to reach out if you need any support or guidance.<br><br>🌟 <div class="total-score">Total Score: <span class="score">30/45</span></div> <br>You're on the right track, but there's still some key pieces to implement and polish up. Keep at it and let's get this app shipshape! 💪<br><br>Cheering you on,<br>Your instructor
