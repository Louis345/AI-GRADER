    <div id="content-to-copy">
      <p>Dear Jr Parcius,</p><p>I have reviewed your final coding project submission and here is my evaluation based on the provided rubric:</p><p>Completion (20/20 pts) ✅
Your project appears to be complete, with all the required components present in the GitHub repository. Great job on ensuring everything is included!</p><p>GitHub Repository (15/20 pts) ⚠️
Your GitHub repository is set up correctly and contains the necessary files. However, I noticed that your commit messages could be more descriptive to better communicate the changes made in each commit. Try to provide clear and concise messages that summarize the purpose of each commit.</p><p>Errors/Functionality (15/20 pts) ⚠️
From the code provided, it seems that your application is functioning as expected. However, without running the code myself, I cannot fully verify if there are any runtime errors or edge cases that need to be handled. In the future, consider including a README file with instructions on how to set up and run your project locally.</p><p>Video (10/20 pts) ⚠️
Thank you for providing a video walkthrough of your project. While the video demonstrates the basic functionality, it would be more informative if you could explain your code structure, design choices, and highlight any challenges you faced during the development process. Additionally, the audio quality could be improved to enhance the overall presentation.</p><p>Total Score: 60/80 (75%)</p><p>Overall, you have done a good job on this final project! Your React application demonstrates a solid understanding of components, state management, and API integration. The code is well-organized and follows best practices.</p><p>To further improve your project, I recommend the following:</p><p>1. Write more descriptive commit messages to better document your development process.
2. Include a README file with setup instructions and any additional information about your project.
3. Enhance your video presentation by providing more insights into your code and the development journey.
4. Consider adding error handling and loading states to improve the user experience.</p><p>Keep up the great work, Jr Parcius! You have shown a strong grasp of React fundamentals, and I am confident that with more practice and refinement, you will excel in building web applications. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance.</p><p>Best regards,
Your Instructor</p>
