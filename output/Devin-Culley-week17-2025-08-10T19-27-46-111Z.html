📊 Completion (<span class="score">220/320 points</span>)<br>Based on your video explanation, it sounds like you implemented most of the required functionality for the React to-do app, including:<br>✅ Creating a React application<br>✅ Using React Router for navigation<br>✅ Implementing task list, add task, and task details components<br>✅ Using React hooks like useState and useParams<br>⚠️ However, without access to the actual code repository, I cannot fully confirm if all requirements were met, such as the API connection and complete CRUD operations. I'm awarding partial credit here based on what was demonstrated in the video.<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">80/280 points</span>)  <br>⚠️ Unfortunately, there was an error accessing your GitHub repository. This prevents me from being able to clone and run your project to test it directly. <br>💡 In the future, double check your repository settings and ensure it is publicly accessible for grading purposes.<br>🌟 I'm still awarding some points in this category based on your video demonstrating a seemingly complete project. But not having access to the code does limit the ability to provide full credit.<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">70/140 points</span>)<br>From what I could see in the video walkthrough, your code seemed to be executing without any major errors:<br>👍 The app was able to render the task list, add new tasks, and display task details<br>✅ Navigation between pages appeared to work smoothly<br>⚠️ However, without being able to run the code myself to test edge cases and check for minor bugs, I can only award partial points here. There's a possibility of small errors that weren't apparent in the demo.<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">60/60 points</span>)<br>🔥 Fantastic job on the video explanation! You earned full points in this category:<br>✨ Clearly demonstrated the functionality of your React to-do app<br>💯 Walked through all the key components and explained relevant code snippets<br>👏 Shown the working app in action, adding tasks, viewing details, and deleting <br>🎥 Video was easy to follow along and covered the core parts of the project<br>🚀 Overall a very solid and thorough project presentation!<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">430/800 points</span><br><br>You've done a great job here, especially with the video presentation! 🙌 The main area for improvement would be ensuring your GitHub repository is publicly accessible so the code can be properly evaluated. Keep up the solid React skills and let me know if you have any other questions!
