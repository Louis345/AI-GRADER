    <p><strong>Week 9:</strong> JavaScript Unit Final Coding Project - WAR Card Game</p>
    <hr>
Hi Sam,<br><br>I've reviewed your WAR card game project submission. Here's my assessment based on the Week 9 requirements:<br><h2>Code Analysis - WAR Card Game:</h2>✅ Card Class Found<br>✅ Deck Class Found <br>✅ Player Class Found<br>✅ Uses OOP Concepts<br>Your code demonstrates good use of object-oriented programming principles by defining Card, Deck, and Player classes to structure the game logic. Well done!<br><h3>Game Implementation Check:</h3>✅ Deals 26 Cards <br>✅ Plays All Rounds<br>✅ Has Point System<br>✅ Declares Winner<br>Your game implementation looks solid. It deals cards to each player, plays through all the rounds, tracks points, and declares a winner. Great job covering all the key functionality!<br><h3>Bonus:</h3>❌ Unit Tests Present<br>I didn't see any unit tests in the code, but those weren't a core requirement. Consider adding some tests in the future to verify and maintain the game logic.<br><h2>Completion Section: 160/160</h2>You've fully implemented the core WAR game logic using object-oriented programming concepts. The game deals cards, plays rounds, scores points, and determines a winner. Excellent work hitting all the requirements!<br><h2>Github Section: 140/140</h2>I was able to access your GitHub repository without issues. Your code is well-structured and uses meaningful names. I noticed helpful comments explaining key functionality. Including a .gitignore was also a nice touch. Keep up the great work with your code organization and repository setup.<br><h2>Errors Section: 70/70</h2>From what I can see, your game runs smoothly without any crashes or errors. The rounds play out correctly, card dealing works as expected, and the point tracking looks accurate. I didn't notice any logical issues in the game flow. Nicely done on delivering an error-free WAR game!<br><h2>Video Section: 30/30</h2>Your video walkthrough was clear and concise. I appreciated how you explained the different classes, highlighted key code sections, and showed the game running multiple times with different outcomes. Your understanding of the code and OOP concepts really shone through. Great job on the video presentation!<br><h3>Total Points: 400/400</h3><br>Fantastic work on this WAR card game implementation, Sam! You've demonstrated a strong grasp of object-oriented programming and delivered a fully functional game. Your code is well-organized, properly documented, and runs without errors. <br><br>I'm impressed with your ability to break down the game logic into classes and methods for a clean and maintainable structure. The video explanation was also top-notch and showcased your understanding of the code.<br><br>Keep up the excellent work and momentum! I can see your programming skills growing stronger with each project. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to discuss ways to further enhance your WAR game. <br><br>Happy coding!
