Hi Amelia! 👋 Let's dive into your "APIs and Fetch" assignment and see how you did. I'll provide feedback section by section, using the rubric as our guide. 📝<br><br>📊 Completion (160 points)<br>✅ Create entities using a form and POST: You implemented a way to create books, genres, and reviews using forms and POST requests. Well done! (<span class="score">40/40 points</span>)<br>✅ Delete entities: Your application allows deleting books, genres, and reviews. For books, you used a popup prompt, while genres and reviews use a textbox for the ID. Nice work providing deletion functionality. (<span class="score">40/40 points</span>)<br>✅ Get and display entities from the API: You fetch and display books, genres, and reviews from the API when the corresponding "Fetch" buttons are clicked. The displayed data looks good! (<span class="score">40/40 points</span>)<br>⚠️ Using Bootstrap and/or CSS for styling: You've included Bootstrap classes in your HTML and have a custom styles.css file. However, the styling is quite minimal. Consider adding more visual enhancements to make your app shine! (<span class="score">30/40 points</span>)<br><br>Completion Score: <span class="score">150/160 points</span><br><br>📱 GitHub Repository (140 points)<br>✅ All code is pushed to GitHub: Your repository contains all the necessary code files. (<span class="score">20/20 points</span>)<br>👏 Includes .gitignore file: You've included a .gitignore file to exclude node_modules and the API_KEY.js file. Good practice! (<span class="score">20/20 points</span>)<br>✅ Project is public with no node_modules in the repo: Your project is public and doesn't contain the node_modules folder. (<span class="score">20/20 points</span>)<br>✅ API key is NOT in the GitHub repo: Your API key is stored in a separate file (API_KEY.js) and is not pushed to the repo, as it's listed in the .gitignore. Well done protecting sensitive information. (<span class="score">20/20 points</span>)<br>⚠️ README.md is filled out: The README.md file exists but could use more details about your project. Consider adding a description, setup instructions, and any other relevant information. (<span class="score">15/20 points</span>)<br>🌟 More than 5 commits: Your commit history shows active development on the project. Keep up the great work! (<span class="score">20/20 points</span>)<br>✨ Repo contains both front and back end code: Your repository includes both the HTML/CSS/JS frontend code and the JSON server backend configuration. (<span class="score">20/20 points</span>)<br><br>GitHub Repository Score: <span class="score">135/140 points</span><br><br>🛠️ Errors/Functionality (70 points)<br>⚠️ No errors in the console: There are a few minor errors logged in the console during certain operations. Let's work on resolving those to ensure a smooth user experience. (<span class="score">30/40 points</span>)<br>✅ Application runs without errors: Despite the minor console errors, your application runs without any major issues. Users can perform CRUD operations on books, genres, and reviews. (<span class="score">30/30 points</span>)<br><br>Errors/Functionality Score: <span class="score">60/70 points</span><br><br>📝 Video Explanation (30 points)<br>🔨 5-10 minute video thoroughly explains the code: Unfortunately, there is no video available in the provided transcript. Make sure to record a video walkthrough of your code, explaining the key components and functionalities. This helps demonstrate your understanding of the project. (<span class="score">0/30 points</span>)<br><br>Video Explanation Score: <span class="score">0/30 points</span><br><br>📈 Total Score: <span class="score">345/400 points</span><br><br>🎉 Fantastic work on this assignment, Amelia! Your application demonstrates a solid understanding of working with APIs using fetch and async/await. The CRUD functionality for books, genres, and reviews is implemented well. 💯<br><br>💡 Some areas for improvement:<br>- Enhance the styling of your application using Bootstrap and custom CSS to create a more polished and visually appealing interface. 🎨<br>- Provide more details in the README.md file to give an overview of your project and help others understand how to set it up and use it. 📚<br>- Debug and fix the minor console errors to ensure a smooth user experience. 🐛<br>- Record a video walkthrough explaining your code and demonstrating the functionality. This helps showcase your understanding and adds a personal touch to your project. 🎥<br><br>Keep up the great work, Amelia! You're making excellent progress. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further guidance. 😊<br><br>Happy coding! 🚀
