    <hr>
üìä Completion (<span class="score">135/160 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ Great job implementing the core game mechanics using classes like Deck and Game! This demonstrates a solid understanding of OOP concepts. <br>‚úÖ Your code successfully deals 26 cards to each player, iterates through all rounds automatically, and awards points appropriately.<br>‚úÖ Excellent work displaying the final score and declaring the winner at the end.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è It would be even better to separate the Player class into its own class definition for cleaner code organization. Consider moving the player1 and player2 properties out of the Game class.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è To fully meet the rubric, consider adding a few more console.log statements to display the round number and make the game flow easier to follow.<br><br>üìù GitHub (<span class="score">115/140 points</span>)  <br>‚úÖ Your repository is properly set up and accessible. Nice work!<br>‚úÖ The code is generally well-organized and uses meaningful variable and function names.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Consider adding more detailed comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each class and method. This will make your code even easier to understand.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è I don't see a .gitignore file in the repository. Make sure to add one to exclude files like node_modules that shouldn't be tracked.<br>üí° As your projects grow, organizing your files into folders like /src or /scripts can help keep things tidy.<br><br>üìà Errors (<span class="score">65/70 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ Fantastic job - your game runs without any major crashes or errors! <br>‚úÖ All 26 rounds seem to execute properly, and the card dealing logic looks solid.<br>‚úÖ Point tracking is working as expected, and the final scores are accurate.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è One small thing to watch out for is potential ties - make sure you handle those correctly and award 0 points to both players.<br>üí° Adding some error handling, like checking for a valid deck before starting the game, could make your code even more robust.<br><br>üì± Video Explanation (<span class="score">25/30 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ Excellent work demonstrating the full game flow from start to finish! I can clearly see each round being played.<br>‚úÖ Your code walkthrough touches on the key aspects of the Deck and Game classes.<br>‚úÖ Discussing the Fisher-Yates shuffle and how you approached it was insightful.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è Consider elaborating a bit more on how the OOP concepts like classes, properties, and methods are used in your implementation. <br>üí° Adding a few code comments in the video could help reinforce the connection between your explanation and the relevant parts of the codebase.<br><br>üåü Total Score: <span class="score">340/400 points</span><br><br>Amazing work on this challenging project, Griselda! You've demonstrated a strong grasp of OOP principles and JavaScript fundamentals. Your code is well-structured, properly handles game logic, and runs smoothly. With some minor tweaks to code organization and documentation, plus a little more depth in your technical explanations, you'll be in fantastic shape. Keep up the great work! üöÄüíØ<br><br>Let me know if you have any other questions!
