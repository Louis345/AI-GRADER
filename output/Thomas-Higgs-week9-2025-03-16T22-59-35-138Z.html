      <p>Thank you for sharing your week 11 assignment code and video walkthrough! I'll provide feedback on your work, following the guidelines you specified.</p><p>Completion (160 points):
✅ The assignment appears to be fully completed, with all required elements present in the provided code files (index.html, index.js).</p><p>GitHub (140 points):
✅ The code is properly stored in a GitHub repository.
✅ The repository contains the necessary files for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.</p><p>Errors/Functionality (70 points):
✅ The game functions as expected, allowing players to enter their names and play Tic-Tac-Toe.
✅ The game properly detects and announces the winner or a draw.
✅ The code handles user interactions and updates the game state accordingly.
⚠️ There are a few minor inconsistencies in variable naming conventions (e.g., camelCase vs. snake_case).</p><p>Video (30 points):
✅ The video provides a clear walkthrough of the code and demonstrates the game's functionality.
✅ The creator explains the key aspects of the code, such as the use of the ternary operator and Unicode symbols.
⚠️ The audio quality could be slightly improved to enhance the overall presentation.</p><p>Total Score: 390/400 (97.5%)</p><p>Summary:
I'm impressed with your implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game! The code is well-structured and follows good practices. The use of the ternary operator and Unicode symbols shows your understanding of JavaScript and adds a nice touch to the game.</p><p>I appreciate that you provided options for different gameplay modes, such as auto mode and turn-by-turn mode. It demonstrates your consideration for user preferences and enhances the overall user experience.</p><p>The video walkthrough is informative and clearly explains the code and its functionality. It's helpful to see the game in action and understand the different aspects of the implementation.</p><p>Suggestions for improvement:
1. Consider using consistent naming conventions throughout the code to improve readability.
2. If possible, explore ways to integrate the game with the VS Code terminal to provide a seamless experience within the development environment.
3. Consider adding some visual enhancements to the game board, such as highlighting the winning combination or animating the placement of X's and O's.</p><p>Overall, great job on this assignment! Your code demonstrates a solid understanding of JavaScript and your ability to create interactive games. Keep up the excellent work!</p><p>If you have any further questions or need clarification on any aspect of the feedback, please let me know. I'm here to help you continue learning and improving your skills.</p>
