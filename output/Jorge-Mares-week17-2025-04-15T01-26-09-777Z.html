Hi Jorge! 👋 I've reviewed your final project submission and have some feedback for you. Let's go through each section of the rubric and see how you did. 📊<br><br>✅ GitHub Repository (280 points)<br>- Your repository is set up correctly with all the required files. Great job! 👏<br>- I see you have a well-organized file structure and clear naming conventions. 💯<br>- README.md file is present, though it could use some more details specific to your project. Consider expanding it a bit. 📝<br><br>⚠️ Errors/Functionality (140 points)<br>- From your video, it seems the core functionality is not fully implemented yet. The ability to add, edit, and delete games is missing. 🛠️ <br>- Search bar is present but not functional. Keep working on hooking it up! 💪<br>- Routing between pages works, which is a good start. Just need to flesh out each page further. 🚀<br><br>⚠️ Completion (320 points)<br>- Homepage, games list, and game info pages exist but are still fairly bare-bones. Aim to add more content and polish to each. 🎨<br>- Connecting to an API to fetch game data is not present yet. This is a key requirement, so be sure to prioritize it. 🔌<br>- CRUD operations are not implemented. Adding this functionality to allow adding, editing, and removing games is essential. 📝 <br><br>📈 Video Explanation (60 points) <br>- Your video does a decent job explaining the current state of your project. I have a general sense of what you were aiming for. ✨<br>- For future videos, I recommend showing a quick demo of the working parts, even if the entire project isn't complete. A picture is worth a thousand words! 📱<br>- Don't forget to mention some of the key technical details and challenges you faced. Reflecting on the development process is valuable. 🧠<br><br>Based on the rubric, here is the score breakdown:<br><br>| Section | Score |<br>| --- | --- |<br>| GitHub Repository | 250 / 280 |<br>| Errors/Functionality | 70 / 140 |<br>| Completion | 100 / 320 |<br>| Video Explanation | 45 / 60 |<br>| <strong>Total</strong> | <strong>465 / 800</strong> |<br><br>I know it's disappointing not to have a complete project, but don't be discouraged. You're on the right track! 💪 I can see the foundation of something really cool here. <br><br>My advice:<br>1. Focus on getting the core functionality (CRUD) working first 🎯 <br>2. Connect it to an API to bring in real game data 🕹️<br>3. Then loop back to polish up the UI/UX ✨<br><br>You've got this, Jorge! Keep up the effort and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any help or guidance. 👍 I'm here to support you.<br><br>Looking forward to seeing your project evolve! 🚀<br><br>Cheers,<br>Your Instructor
