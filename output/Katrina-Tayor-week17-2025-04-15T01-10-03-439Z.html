Hi Katrina! 👋 I've reviewed your final React book library app and have some feedback for you. Let's go through each section of the rubric:<br><br>📊 Completion (320 points)<br>✅ Your app looks feature-complete and includes the required pages and functionality. The navigation with React Router is working well. Nice work on getting all the main pieces in place! You've earned the full 320 points here. 💯<br><br>📝 GitHub Repository (280 points) <br>✨ Your GitHub repo is set up properly with all the required files. The code is well-organized into components and follows good React practices. I'm deducting 20 points since there are a few minor warnings in the console about form attributes, but overall your code quality is solid. 260 points awarded. 👍<br><br>📈 Errors/Functionality (140 points)<br>⚠️ The core functionality of viewing, adding, and deleting books is working. However, I noticed the update functionality wasn't working initially in your demo. You were able to fix it, but there are still a couple small bugs to iron out. I'm awarding 100 points here - keep refining those final pieces! 💪<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (60 points)<br>🌟 Excellent job walking through your app in the video! You highlighted all the key features and gave a clear, thoughtful explanation of how everything works behind the scenes. I can tell you have a strong grasp of the concepts. Full 60 points earned! 🔥<br><br>🖥️ Total Score: 320 + 260 + 100 + 60 = 740/800 <br><br>💡 Strengths:<br>- Solid understanding of React concepts like Router and Context <br>- Clean, well-structured code<br>- All main features are in place and functioning <br>- Great job with the video walkthrough!<br><br>🛠️ Areas for Improvement:<br>- Fix the couple of remaining bugs with updating books<br>- Clear out those few minor console warnings<br>- Consider adding some more styling to take the app to the next level visually<br><br>Overall, this is an impressive project Katrina! You've demonstrated a strong command of React and put together a functional, well-thought-out app. With a bit more polish to smooth out the final wrinkles, this will be an excellent showcase piece. 🚀 <br><br>Keep up the great work - you should be proud of what you've built here! Let me know if you have any other questions. 😊<br><br>Cheers,<br>Your Instructor
