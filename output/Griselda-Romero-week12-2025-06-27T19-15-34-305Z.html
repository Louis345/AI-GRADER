    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of the assignment:<br><br>📊 Completion (<span class="score">140/160 points</span>)<br>✅ Fetch API used successfully to retrieve book data<br>✅ Async/await implemented properly in fetchBooks function <br>✅ Create (POST) functionality working to add new books<br>✅ Read (GET) functionality displaying book list <br>⚠️ Delete functionality not fully working (-10 points)<br>✅ Form properly connected to add new books<br>✅ json-server used as fake backend API<br><br>Overall, great work on implementing the core CRUD functionality! The fetch calls are handled well using async/await. Just need to debug the delete button to get it working properly. Keep it up! 💪<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">115/140 points</span>)  <br>✅ GitHub repository is accessible <br>⚠️ File structure is a bit disorganized with files at top level (-10 points)<br>⚠️ Code has some minor formatting inconsistencies (-5 points)<br>⚠️ README is very minimal, lacking setup instructions (-10 points)<br>✅ Commit history shows project development over time<br><br>Good job using GitHub to manage your project. To improve, organize your files into folders, add more details to the README, and be consistent with code formatting. Overall though, your repo demonstrates your progress! 🌟<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">60/70 points</span>)<br>✅ No major errors or unexpected behaviors<br>⚠️ Delete functionality not working (-10 points) <br>✅ Create and read operations work smoothly<br>✅ Proper error handling for required form fields<br>✅ Async/await used without issues<br>✅ UI responds as expected to adding books<br><br>You've done well to avoid any critical errors. The main issue is the delete functionality, but that is not causing the app to crash. Keep debugging that delete button - you're close to getting it working! 💡<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">20/30 points</span>)<br>✅ Explanation covers the key aspects of the app<br>⚠️ Demo did not show successful deletion of a book (-5 points)<br>⚠️ Additional code walkthrough would have been helpful (-5 points)<br>✅ Discusses the use of json-server as a mock API <br><br>The video gives a solid overview of your book tracking app. Showing a successful demo of all CRUD operations, including deletion, would make it even stronger. Don't be afraid to go into more detail on your code too. Just a bit more polish and your videos will be top-notch! 👍<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">335/400 points</span><br><br>You've done an excellent job on this assignment! Your book tracking app is functional and meets the core requirements. <br><br>The main areas for improvement are:<br>- Debugging the delete functionality 🛠️ <br>- Organizing your GitHub repo files 📂<br>- Enhancing the README with setup steps 📝 <br>- Showing a start-to-finish demo in the video 🎥<br><br>Keep practicing and refining your coding skills. You're on the right track - keep up the fantastic work! 🚀<br><br>Let me know if you have any other questions!
