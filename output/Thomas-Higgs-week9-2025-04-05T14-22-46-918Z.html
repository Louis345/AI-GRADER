      <p>Hi there! Thanks for sharing your work on the Week 11 assignment. I'll provide some feedback following the rubric structure provided. Feel free to let me know if you have any other questions!</p><p>📊 Completion (160 pts)
✅ Based on the provided code and video walkthrough, it appears you have implemented all the key functionality required for the assignment. The game allows selecting auto or manual mode, deals cards, determines the winner, and provides random responses. Great job on completing the core features! You've earned the full 160 points for this section. 💯</p><p>📝 GitHub Repository (140 pts)
✅ Your GitHub repository looks well-organized, with separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code is clean and readable. The repository meets the requirements outlined in the rubric. You receive the full 140 points for your GitHub setup. 🌟</p><p>📈 Errors/Functionality (70 pts)
⚠️ While your game functions as intended in the browser console, you mentioned having difficulties getting it to work with readline in the VS Code terminal. It's okay to have separate versions for different environments. Consider this a learning opportunity to further explore integrating readline with your code. Despite this minor issue, your game works well overall. I'm awarding you 60 out of 70 points for this section. Keep up the good work! 💪</p><p>📱 Video Explanation (30 pts)
✅ Your video walkthrough effectively demonstrates the game's functionality and highlights key aspects of your code. You explain the use of the ternary operator, Unicode symbols, and the overall game flow. The video provides a clear understanding of your implementation. You've earned the full 30 points for the video explanation. 🔥</p><p>🖥️ Total Score
Based on the points assigned for each section, your total score is:
<ul><li>Completion: 160/160</li>
<li>GitHub Repository: 140/140</li>
<li>Errors/Functionality: 60/70</li>
