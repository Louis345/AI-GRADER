<p>📝 Feedback for John Dudas - Week 12 Assignment: API's and Fetch</p><p>Hello John! 👋 I've reviewed your CRUD application and have some feedback for you. Let's go through each section of the rubric:</p><p>📊 Completion (160 points)
✅ Your application meets the basic requirements of using json-server or another API, implementing forms for creating/posting entities, and including deletion functionality. Well done! 👏
⚠️ However, I didn't see the update functionality implemented. Remember, the assignment asks for a CRUD application without the update feature. Make sure to double-check the requirements next time. 
Score: 140/160</p><p>📱 GitHub Repository (140 points)
✅ Your GitHub repository is set up correctly with the necessary files and structure. Great job organizing your code! 🌟
✅ The repository includes a .gitignore file to exclude the node_modules folder. Excellent attention to detail. 💯
Score: 140/140</p><p>🛠️ Errors/Functionality (70 points)
✅ Your application runs without any major errors. The tasks can be added, marked as complete, and deleted successfully. Nicely done! 🔥
💡 There are a few areas where the code could be refactored for better readability and maintainability. Consider breaking down some of the larger functions into smaller, reusable ones. 
Score: 60/70</p><p>🖥️ Video Explanation (30 points)
✅ Your video walkthrough covers the main aspects of your code and demonstrates the functionality of your application. Good job explaining the key parts! 👍
⚠️ The video could benefit from better audio quality and a more structured approach to the explanation. Try rehearsing beforehand and focusing on clearly conveying the important points.
Score: 25/30</p><p>📈 Total Score: 365/400</p><p>📝 Summary and Suggestions
Overall, you've done a solid job on this assignment, John! Your CRUD application meets most of the requirements and functions as expected. Here are a few suggestions for improvement:</p><p>🔨 Review the assignment requirements carefully to ensure you've implemented all the necessary features. In this case, the update functionality was not needed.
💡 Consider refactoring your code to improve readability and maintainability. Breaking down large functions into smaller, reusable ones can make your code easier to understand and modify.
🚀 For future video explanations, aim for better audio quality and a more structured approach. Rehearse your main points beforehand to deliver a clear and concise walkthrough.</p><p>Keep up the good work, John! You're making great progress. 💪 Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance. </p><p>Best regards,
Your Instructor 😊</p>
