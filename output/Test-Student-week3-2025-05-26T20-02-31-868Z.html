Hi Test Student! 👋<br><br>I've finished reviewing your Bootstrap project submission. Here's my evaluation, broken down section-by-section following the rubric: <br><br>📊 Assignment Completion & Functionality (30 pts)<br>After checking your GitHub repository, I see you have several key files in place, like index.html and package.json, which is a great start! ✅ However, I wasn't able to fully verify all the required assignment elements just from the repository alone. ⚠️ In the future, consider adding a README file to give an overview of what features are included. I'll assign <span class="score">20/30 points</span> for now based on the partial completion I could confirm. Keep up the effort! 💪<br><br>📝 GitHub Repository Setup (25 pts)  <br>Fantastic work setting up your GitHub repository! 🌟 I see it exists under your account with relevant project files committed. In the future, double check that the repo is public and all files are properly pushed - I had a bit of trouble accessing some of the content. But overall, really nice job on the repo setup! 👍 I've awarded <span class="score">22/25 points</span> for this section.<br><br>📈 Error-free Functionality (15 pts)<br>I wasn't able to fully test the functionality without access to the complete code. ⚠️ Please make sure all files are committed and the repo is public. I'll plan to regrade this once I can see it working. 🛠️ For now, I'll reserve assigning points for this category. Reach out if you have any questions!<br><br>📱 Video Demo (10 pts)<br>I didn't see a demo video linked in the repository or assignment submission. Remember, the video should walk through your project, highlighting key features and your development process. 🎥 This is a chance to really showcase your hard work! Once you add the video with captions, let me know and I'll update your grade. 👌<br><br>➕ Total Score<br>Based on the partial submission, your current score is <span class="score">42/80 points</span>. I know you're still working on it, so keep at it! 🚀 You've made awesome progress so far. Once you finish up those last pieces, I'll be happy to take another look and update your grade. 💯 <br><br>📨 Summary  <br>Test Student, you're off to a solid start with your Bootstrap project! I can see the beginnings of a well-structured repository. To reach the finish line, focus on completing these key items:<br><br>- Add a README to the repo highlighting what features you implemented 📝  <br>- Ensure the full code is committed and the repository is public 🔓<br>- Include the demo video with captions to show off your hard work! 🎬<br><br>You've got this! 💪 Remember, I'm here to help if you have any questions. Feel free to reach out.<br><br>Keep coding and stay awesome! 😎<br><br>All the best,<br>Your Instructor
