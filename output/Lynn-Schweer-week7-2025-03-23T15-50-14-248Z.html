      <p>Hi Lynn, great work on your Week 7 JavaScript assignment! Let me provide some feedback on your submission, following the grading rubric.</p><p>Completion (35/30 points) ✅
You've done an excellent job completing all the required elements outlined in the assignment description. Your code covers all the questions and problems posed. Well done!</p><p>GitHub (25/25 points) ✅
Your GitHub repository is set up correctly with the required files (index.html and index.js). The code is well-structured, readable, and properly commented. Great job maintaining a clean and organized repository.</p><p>Errors/Functionality (20/15 points) ⚠️
Your code runs without any major errors, which is fantastic. However, there are a few minor issues to address:
<ul><li>In question 6, you're concatenating numbers to an array instead of calculating the sum. This doesn't produce the expected result.</li>
<li>In question 7, you're logging the function call instead of calling the function with the provided arguments.</li>
<li>In question 11, the function doesn't handle the case when the averages are equal.</li></ul></p><p>These are relatively small issues, but it's important to double-check your code to ensure it fully meets the requirements.</p><p>Video Explanation (8/10 points) ⚠️
Your video walkthrough covers most of the key points of your code. You explain your thought process and demonstrate the functionality of your solutions. However, the video could benefit from a bit more detail in certain parts, such as explaining the specific methods used (e.g., concat, push) and their purposes. Additionally, the audio quality could be improved to enhance the overall presentation.</p><p>Total Score: 88/80 (110%)</p><p>Summary:
Lynn, you've demonstrated a solid understanding of JavaScript concepts and successfully applied them to solve the given problems. Your code is well-organized, and your explanations show a clear grasp of the material. To take your work to the next level, I recommend the following:</p><p>1. Carefully review your code to catch any minor logical errors or inconsistencies.
2. Provide more detailed explanations in your video, covering the purpose and functionality of specific methods and concepts used.
3. Consider enhancing the audio quality of your video to improve the overall presentation.</p><p>Keep up the great work, Lynn! You're making excellent progress, and with a few refinements, you'll be well on your way to mastering JavaScript. If you have any questions or need further guidance, don't hesitate to reach out. Keep coding and keep learning!</p>
