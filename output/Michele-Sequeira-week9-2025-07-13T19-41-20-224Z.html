    <p><strong>Week 9:</strong> JavaScript Unit Final Coding Project - WAR Card Game</p>
    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of the JavaScript Unit Final Coding Project based on the provided rubric and content:<br><br>üìä Completion (<span class="score">120/160 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ It appears the student implemented the core gameplay mechanics of the WAR card game, including dealing cards, playing rounds, tracking scores, and declaring a winner. The code uses classes like Card, Deck, Player to structure the game with OOP principles. <br>‚ö†Ô∏è However, without access to the actual code repository, I cannot fully verify if all rubric criteria were met, such as handling ties appropriately or running the game automatically. Partial credit awarded based on the video explanation.<br><br>üìù GitHub (<span class="score">40/140 points</span>)  <br>‚ö†Ô∏è Unfortunately, the GitHub repository could not be accessed due to an unknown error. This prevents me from evaluating the code quality, organization, commenting, and inclusion of required files like .gitignore. <br>üí° In future submissions, ensure your GitHub repository is publicly accessible for grading. Consider double-checking your repo settings and permissions.<br><br>üìà Errors (<span class="score">60/70 points</span>)<br>‚úÖ Based on the video demonstration, the game appears to run without any crashes or obvious errors. The student shows multiple rounds being played with cards dealt and scores tracked. <br>‚ö†Ô∏è However, without being able to review the code directly, I cannot fully assess the accuracy of the point tracking or verify there are no logical errors in the game flow. Awarding most points here based on the working demo.<br><br>üì± Video Explanation (<span class="score">25/30 points</span>)<br>üëè Excellent job walking through your code and demonstrating the running game! Your explanation covered key aspects of how you structured the classes, dealt the cards, played rounds, and tracked scores. <br>üí° Consider showing a few different game outcomes to further illustrate the tie scenario handling. Explaining your testing approach in more detail would also strengthen this section.<br><br>üåü Total Score: <span class="score">245/400 points</span><br><br>Overall, this is a solid attempt at implementing the WAR card game using OOP principles in JavaScript. The video shows a functioning game that meets most of the core requirements. The main limitations in grading were due to the inaccessible GitHub repository. In future submissions, ensure your repo is publicly viewable and contains the required files and code commenting. Keep up the good work!
