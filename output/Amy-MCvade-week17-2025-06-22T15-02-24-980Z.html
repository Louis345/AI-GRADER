Here is my evaluation of the final project submission:<br><br>📊 Completion (<span class="score">220/320 points</span>)<br>✅ React application created<br>✅ API connection established with mock API file<br>✅ CRUD operations implemented (adding/deleting slides, updating font)<br>⚠️ Missing one required page (submit page)<br>💡 Most requirements have been attempted, but the missing page prevents awarding full points. Keep working to get that last piece functional!<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">180/280 points</span>)  <br>✅ GitHub URL provided<br>⚠️ Unable to verify if project can be cloned and run due to missing file structure in repository<br>💡 Make sure to push your complete project structure to GitHub. This should include your source code, dependencies, and any configuration files needed to run the project.<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">70/140 points</span>)<br>✅ Main application page works without errors<br>✅ Implemented features like adding/deleting slides and updating font work as expected <br>⚠️ Significant errors with routing and missing page prevents full functionality<br>🛠️ Debug the routing issue to get the submit page displaying. Also handle any errors that may be preventing the layouts page from working.<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">60/60 points</span>)<br>🌟 Video clearly demos the working parts of the project <br>💯 Explanation covered all the key components and functionality<br>👍 Despite missing page, video showcased the efforts put into the project<br>🚀 Nice job walking through the code and highlighting the technical requirements that were met!<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">530/800 points</span><br><br>Amy, you put in a lot of great work on this project! 👏 I can see the significant effort you've put into building out the main application functionality. The slide management with adding, deleting and updating is working smoothly. 🎉<br><br>The areas that still need some attention are the routing and the missing submit page. Debugging those will be key to rounding out the project. 💪 Don't hesitate to reach out to your mentor for guidance on troubleshooting that last part.<br><br>I know it's frustrating to run up against the deadline with a piece still not working. But don't let that overshadow all the great work you did and the learning that happened along the way! 🙌 I have confidence that with a bit more time and debugging, you'll get that last piece sorted out.<br><br>Keep up the coding! You're making great progress on your programming journey. 🚀 Let me know if you have any other questions!
