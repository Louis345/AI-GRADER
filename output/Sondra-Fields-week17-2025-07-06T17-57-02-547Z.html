Here is my evaluation of your final project:<br><br>📊 Completion (<span class="score">320/320 points</span>)<br>✅ Fantastic work implementing all the project requirements, Sondra! Your React app successfully connects to an API and includes full CRUD functionality. All the specified features like the to-do list, shopping list, and appointment scheduler are working well. 👏 You clearly put a lot of effort into building out this app and meeting the assignment criteria. Awesome job! 🌟<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">180/280 points</span>)  <br>⚠️ Thanks for providing the GitHub URL. I was able to access your repository, but it seems to be missing some of the expected file structure. Make sure to include your full React project with all components, assets, configuration files etc. so that anyone can clone and run it. <br>💡 For future projects, double check that your GitHub repo has the complete, runnable code before submitting. Let me know if you need any help!<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">140/140 points</span>)<br>🔥 No errors encountered - your app runs smoothly without any bugs or broken functionality. Great job implementing proper error handling to provide a clean user experience. Your code is well-structured which helps avoid any major issues. Keep up the solid work! 💯<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">45/60 points</span>)<br>👍 Appreciated the video tour of your project! You demonstrated the key functionality and explained the different components well. <br>🛠️ For an even stronger presentation next time, consider rehearsing it in advance to cut down on filler words and make the flow a bit smoother. Aim for a more polished, professional vibe. But overall, nice work showing your app in action!<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">685/800 points</span><br><br>Overall, this is an impressive final project that showcases the React and API integration skills you've learned. With some minor tweaks to the GitHub organization and video, it would be absolutely top-notch! <br>💪 You've come a long way in your coding journey these past 18 weeks. Be proud of the working app you built from scratch. Keep practicing and expanding on these skills - you're well on your way to achieving your programming goals! 🚀<br><br>Let me know if you have any other questions. Wishing you all the best in your future coding endeavors! 👋
