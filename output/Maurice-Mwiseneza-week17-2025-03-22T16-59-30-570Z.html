      <p>Okay Maurice, I've thoroughly reviewed your final coding project submission, including the GitHub repository code and your video presentation. Here is my detailed evaluation and feedback:</p><p>Completion (20/32 points): ⚠️
<ul><li>You implemented a React todo app with CRUD functionality, which mostly meets the core requirements. </li>
<li>However, I don't see evidence of 10 custom components being used. It looks closer to 5-6 components.</li>
<li>The app also seems to be missing some of the finer details outlined in the requirements, like input validation.</li></p><p>GitHub Repository (24/28 points): ✅
<li>Your GitHub repo is well structured and contains all the necessary files for the React app (components, pages, css, etc.)</li>
<li>The code is cleanly written and follows good practices like using meaningful names, proper indentation, etc.</li>
<li>Some minor suggestions: Add a README file describing the app and how to run it. Also consider adding comments to explain key parts of the code.</li></p><p>Errors/Functionality (10/14 points): ⚠️ 
<li>The core CRUD functionality with the todo API works well - you can add, complete, and delete todos successfully.</li>
<li>However, I noticed the alert when submitting an empty todo doesn't seem to be triggered properly. This error handling could be improved.</li>
<li>The Contact form also appears to be non-functional (though this may be intended based on your comments).</li></p><p>Video Presentation (4/6 points): ✅
<li>Your video does a solid job walking through the key parts of your code and demoing the app functionality.</li>
<li>The audio is mostly clear and you explain the key components, API calls, and states in the app.</li>
<li>The video could be improved with a little more detail on the overall app structure/components and perhaps an introduction/summary slide. But overall it meets the basic requirements.</li></ul></p><p>Total Score: 58/80 (72.5%)</p><p>Summary:
You've done a commendable job on this final project Maurice! You've built a functioning React todo app that meets most of the core requirements and demonstrated a solid grasp of React fundamentals. The code is well-organized and the app handles the key CRUD operations successfully. </p><p>To take this to the next level, I'd recommend adding in the remaining pieces outlined in the requirements (like more custom components, form validation, etc.). Make sure error handling is thorough and all the edge cases are accounted for. Updating the Contact form to be functional would also be a nice enhancement.</p><p>On the whole though, this is a strong foundation and you should be proud of the work you've done! Keep practicing and expanding on these skills. Let me know if you have any other questions!</p>
