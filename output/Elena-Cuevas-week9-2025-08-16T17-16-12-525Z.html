    <p><strong>Week 9:</strong> JavaScript Unit Final Coding Project - WAR Card Game</p>
    <hr>
Here is my evaluation of your WAR Card Game assignment for Week 9:<br><br>Code Analysis:<br>❌ I don't see a Card class implemented in the code provided. This is a core requirement for object-oriented programming in this project.<br>❌ There doesn't appear to be a Deck class either. The Deck class should handle creating and shuffling the card deck.  <br>❌ I'm also not seeing a Player class to represent each player and their hands/scores.<br>❌ Without the key classes, the project is not demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts as required.<br><br>Game Implementation:<br>❌ From the code provided, I can't verify that the game properly deals 26 cards to each player from a 52 card deck.<br>❌ It's unclear if the game plays through all rounds automatically based on the code snippets. <br>❌ I don't see a point tracking system implemented to award points to the player with the higher card.<br>❌ There is no clear logic shown to determine and declare a winner at the end of the game.<br><br>Completion: 0/160<br>- The core classes (Card, Deck, Player) are not present, so object-oriented programming is not demonstrated.<br>- Without the full code, I can't verify if the game deals cards properly, plays through all rounds, tracks points, and declares a winner.<br>- Using console.log() for output is a good approach for this project.<br><br>GitHub: 35/140<br>✅ The GitHub repository was created and is accessible.<br>⚠️ There are no code files present in the repository, so I cannot evaluate code quality, organization, variable/function naming, or .gitignore.  <br><br>Errors: 0/70 <br>- Without the full code, I cannot assess if the game runs without errors or if the game logic is properly implemented.<br><br>Video: 20/30<br>✅ The video does a good job showing the intended flow of the game from start to finish.<br>✅ Your voice explanation of how the code should work is clear.<br>⚠️ The video references some key aspects of the code design, but without showing the actual code implementation it's hard to fully demonstrate your understanding.<br>⚠️ The video doesn't highlight the most important parts of the code you wrote.<br><br>Total Points: 55/400<br><br>Elena, while your video shows a good high-level understanding of the project goals, the code and repository is missing many of the key deliverables for this assignment. The three core classes are not present, so it's not possible to verify if object-oriented programming concepts were properly applied. The game logic also can't be evaluated without the code that handles card dealing, round iteration, point tracking and winner declaration.<br><br>To improve the project, I recommend:<br>1) Implementing the Card, Deck and Player classes <br>2) Ensure the game logic fully plays through all rounds, tracks points and determines a winner<br>3) Committing your code to the GitHub repository<br>4) Updating the video to highlight key portions of your actual code implementation<br><br>Please let me know if you have any other questions! With some work on the OOP class design and game implementation, I know you can get this project to meet all the requirements. Keep up the effort!
