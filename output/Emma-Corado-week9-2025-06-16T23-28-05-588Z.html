📊 Completion (<span class="score">140/160 points</span>)<br>✅ Great job using classes for Card, Deck, and Player to implement an object-oriented structure for the game! Your code follows the basic requirements of dealing cards, iterating through rounds, tracking points, and declaring a winner. 👏<br><br>⚠️ However, it looks like you may be missing a few small details from the criteria, such as handling ties appropriately by awarding zero points. Make sure to double check the requirements and implement all the specified functionality for full points! 💡<br><br>📝 GitHub (<span class="score">120/140 points</span>)  <br>✅ Your GitHub repository is set up correctly and the code is accessible. Nice work including a .gitignore file to keep things clean! 🌟<br><br>💡 Consider adding more detailed code comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each section. This will make your code even easier to read and maintain. Also, work on using consistently meaningful names for variables and functions. A few could be more descriptive.<br><br>📈 Errors (<span class="score">60/70 points</span>)<br>✅ Fantastic, your game runs without any major errors or crashes! It looks like all 26 rounds are playing out as expected. 🔥<br><br>⚠️ However, double check your point tracking and game flow logic. There might be a small issue with ties not being handled quite right, and make sure the final score is accurate. With a few small tweaks, you'll have a perfectly functioning game! 🛠️<br><br>📱 Video Explanation (<span class="score">25/30 points</span>)<br>✅ Great walkthrough of your code! I can tell you have a solid understanding of how everything works together. Your audio and screen share are clear and easy to follow along with. 💯<br><br>💡 For an even stronger explanation, try highlighting specific parts of the code as you talk through the key functionality and design decisions. Explaining how the OOP concepts are applied would also take this to the next level! Keep up the great work. 🚀<br><br>🌟 Total Score: <span class="score">345/400 points</span><br><br>Overall, fantastic work on this assignment! You've demonstrated a strong understanding of object-oriented programming and applied it well to building out the classic card game of War. With just a few small adjustments and some extra polish, this will be an excellent addition to your portfolio. Keep up the amazing effort! 👍<br><br>Let me know if you have any other questions - I'm always happy to help. You've got this! 💪
